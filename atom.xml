Furthermore, you can specify which microphone and camera you would like to use during a screen capturing session before you hit the record button.

Filmora is easy to use and powerful enough to record, and edit your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Including the webcam footage in your screen recordings can make them more entertaining to watch, since viewers can actually see the person who is talking to them. Although Windows 10’s Game Bar features the tools you are going to need to record a computer screen, capturing the webcam video stream simultaneously is a highly technical and time-consuming task. That is why it is much better to use Filmora or the Loom extension for Google Chrome if you want to record your screen and use a webcam at the same time. Which method of capturing webcam video streams and computer screens do you like to use the most?

Furthermore, you can specify which microphone and camera you would like to use during a screen capturing session before you hit the record button. Loom will record all of your screen activities and you can use it to record your gaming experiences, create tutorials or any other type of video that includes the tasks you perform on your computer.</p><p>However, you may meet some audio quality issues on some occasions, and once recorded, the editing options are limited (though I can add A CTA button and do some setting, I can’t do other editing such as add title, adjust speed and mute audio in the video except trimming).</p><p>So, if you want to record the webcam and screen at the same time, and edit the recorded footage further with effects, transitions, titles, we recommend you to try Filmora. Filmora is easy to use and powerful enough to record, and edit your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Including the webcam footage in your screen recordings can make them more entertaining to watch, since viewers can actually see the person who is talking to them. Although Windows 10’s Game Bar features the tools you are going to need to record a computer screen, capturing the webcam video stream simultaneously is a highly technical and time-consuming task. That is why it is much better to use Filmora or the Loom extension for Google Chrome if you want to record your screen and use a webcam at the same time. Which method of capturing webcam video streams and computer screens do you like to use the most?

Selecting the destination folder where your recordings are going to be saved, picking a preferred <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >frame rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or choosing the quality of the video you’re capturing are also among the options you’ll have at your disposal.</p><p>Make sure to tick the Show Mouse Clicks in Recording checkbox if you would like your video to include all mouse clicks you make during a screen capturing session. Filmora also offers the option to record all mouse click sounds, but most content creators disable this setting as mouse clicks can be very repetitive.</p><p>Record the Camera Stream checkbox is located at the bottom of the Wondershare Filmora Scrn window, and you have to click on it if you want to record your computer screen and the webcam video simultaneously. By default, the computer’s built-in webcam is going to be selected, but you can also select an external webcam you connected to your computer, from the drop-down menu located directly below the Record the Camera Stream checkbox.</p><p>Optionally, you can set the keyboard shortcuts that enable you to start, stop, pause and resume a screen recording session. Click on the Record button when ready and proceed to record your computer’s screen and the webcam stream simultaneously.</p><p>After the screen capturing session, the video file you created will be located in the destination folder you specified and appeared in the media library automatically, so you just have to place it onto the timeline if you want to edit it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Computer-Screen-and-Webcam-Video-at-the-same-time-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?"></a>Part 2: How to Record a Computer Screen and Webcam Video at the same time on Windows 10?</h2><p>All you need to do in order to access the Game Bar on Windows 10 is to use the Win + G keyboard shortcut. The screen capturing options you will have at your disposal are underwhelming at best since you won’t be able to select the resolution or the frame rate of the video you’re recording. However, you just need to enable the microphone and click on the Record button to start capturing the gameplay of the video game you’re playing or any other activity on your computer.</p><p>Even though it is possible to record a webcam video and capture a screen simultaneously, you can only do so if you install additional encoders. It may take a while to figure out the exact steps of this highly technical process, and once you do, you still won’t be able to record the webcam video stream and capture a computer screen with the same app.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome-3"><a href="#Part-3-Capturing-Screens-with-Loom-Extension-for-Google-Chrome-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome"></a>Part 3: Capturing Screens with Loom Extension for Google Chrome</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/loom-video-recorder-scree/liecbddmkiiihnedobmlmillhodjkdmb?hl=en-US" >Loom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> extension for Google Chrome web browser offers a simple and easy solution to all PC users who would like to record screens and webcam videos at the same time. The extension can be downloaded for free, and the setup process won’t take much more than a few moments. Before you can start using Loom, you must first sign in using your Google account and then grant the extension access to your computer’s microphone and camera.</p><p>This extension for Google Chrome lets you choose if you want to record only the computer’s screen, webcam or both at the same time. Furthermore, you can specify which microphone and camera you would like to use during a screen capturing session before you hit the record button. Loom will record all of your screen activities and you can use it to record your gaming experiences, create tutorials or any other type of video that includes the tasks you perform on your computer.</p><p>However, you may meet some audio quality issues on some occasions, and once recorded, the editing options are limited (though I can add A CTA button and do some setting, I can’t do other editing such as add title, adjust speed and mute audio in the video except trimming).</p><p>So, if you want to record the webcam and screen at the same time, and edit the recorded footage further with effects, transitions, titles, we recommend you to try Filmora. Filmora is easy to use and powerful enough to record, and edit your video.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1702748">                    <video width="192" height="320" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1702748">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1702748.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:120px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftwopages.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1702748%2F18544'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702748/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Including the webcam footage in your screen recordings can make them more entertaining to watch, since viewers can actually see the person who is talking to them. Although Windows 10’s Game Bar features the tools you are going to need to record a computer screen, capturing the webcam video stream simultaneously is a highly technical and time-consuming task. That is why it is much better to use Filmora or the Loom extension for Google Chrome if you want to record your screen and use a webcam at the same time.

Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115909/19272" target="_top" id="2115909">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115909" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115909/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137214/26400" target="_top" id="2137214">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137214" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137214/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115917/19272" target="_top" id="2115917">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115917" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115917/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature.

The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-1"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game.

While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

The multiplayer in Warhammer 2 is also very strong, although this is due more to a large number of generally well-defined and realized factions and races than to any specific improvements in the mode.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Real time tactics.</p><p>• Strategy based.</p><p>• AI controlled factions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3"><a href="#6-Total-War-Medieval-2-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Total War Medieval 2"></a>6.Total War Medieval 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-medieval-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="total-war-medieval-2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>These last two entries are almost interchangeable since they are both excellent examples of best total war games, but because this is a ranking list, I’ll offer a specific response. Medieval 2 is essentially the same game as Medieval 1, but with improved visuals, updated gameplay, and additional features. Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-behind-the-scenes-of-iscreen-capture-for-2024/"><u>[New] Behind the Scenes of iScreen Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-screen-savvy-secure-your-captures-chromebooks-top-4-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Screen Savvy Secure Your Captures - Chromebook's Top 4 Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-ultimate-screen-snapper-unlocking-zd-softwares-potential-for-2024/"><u>[New] Ultimate Screen Snapper Unlocking ZD Software's Potential for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-examining-splitcam-top-video-recorder/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Examining SplitCam Top Video Recorder?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-4-effective-ways-to-snip-screens-on-chromebook-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 4 Effective Ways to Snip Screens On Chromebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-secret-to-stellar-instagram-photos-pro-techniques-uncovered/"><u>2024 Approved The Secret to Stellar Instagram Photos Pro Techniques Uncovered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/disentangled-rtx-manager-access/"><u>Disentangled: RTX Manager Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-realme-gt-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Realme GT 5 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/telecharger-gratuitement-les-meilleurs-extracteurs-de-dvd-pour-windows-1011-en-202-cuit-version-complete/"><u>Télécharger Gratuitement Les Meilleurs Extracteurs De DVD Pour Windows 10/11 en 202 Cuit - Version Complète</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons.

It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like. Our unit’s clicky ones feature a short pre-travel range and low operational force, making them easy to push for gaming. The delay is also quite common, thus there should be no noticeable lag when gaming. The EVGA Release RGB software allows you to remap all keys, but it isn’t as user-friendly as other rival manufacturers’ software.</p><h5 id="Pros-18"><a href="#Pros-18" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Keyboard is best suited to gaming.</p><p>It’s a straightforward keyboard with excellent ergonomics and comfy wrist rest.</p><h5 id="Cons-18"><a href="#Cons-18" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keys are too touchy for typing.</p><p>Keys can be noisy in a noisy setting.</p><h3 id="5-Corsair-K63-3"><a href="#5-Corsair-K63-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Corsair K63"></a>5.Corsair K63</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-k63.jpg"                      alt="corsair-k63"                ></p><p>Corsair K63 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with the wireless link we’ve tested. This mechanical TenKeyLess variant may connect to up to 2 different devices at the same time, either through the USB receiver or over Bluetooth. The ergonomics are excellent since it’s a horizontal keyboard with just one inclination option. However, the wrist rest looks cheap.</p><p>Only linear MX Red Cherry keys are available, which take little effort to activate and provide no tactile feedback. Although the pre-travel length is somewhat greater than that of comparable gaming keyboards, the switches are still extremely sensitive and should not cause fatigue. You can reprogram or assign macros to any key, and it has some additional features like dedicated media buttons and a Windows lockout that stops you from inadvertently minimizing your game.</p><h5 id="Pros-19"><a href="#Pros-19" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>The quality and reliability are just adequate since the frame is composed of cheap-feeling plastic.</p><h5 id="Cons-19"><a href="#Cons-19" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The illumination is limited to single blue color.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt;

All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Apache OpenMeetings"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://openmeetings.apache.org/" >Apache OpenMeetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu</p><p>This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6.

Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="7.

The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.</p><h3 id="8-TeamViewer"><a href="#8-TeamViewer" class="headerlink" title="8.

Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers.

Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly.

You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let’s discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.</p><p>**<strong>Free and User-Friendly</strong></p><p>The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use RecordCast"></a>Part 2: How to Use RecordCast</h2><p>With the three RecordCast, you can record your screen or webcam, download it and edit it the way you like to online.

However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.</p><ul><li><strong>Account</strong></li></ul><p>Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.</p><ul><li><strong>Operating system</strong></li></ul><p>Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.</p><ul><li><strong>Participation in a video call</strong></li></ul><p>To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134239/18498" target="_top" id="2134239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="721" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134239/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Filters-Effects-or-Masks-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?</h2><p>Google Meet lets you add filters, effects, and masks to make a video call a fun-filled activity.
