Webcams are commonly used during screen recording sessions, to capture the footage of the narrator, but a simple mistake like, not paying attention to the video’s background can ruin a perfectly captured webcam video.</p><p>Besides removing the messy backgrounds, you can also add templates or custom made backgrounds to webcam videos if you would like to hide private information, put the accent on the narrator of the video or improve its overall quality. In this guide, we are going to show you how to replace or remove the background while you are recording webcam videos with Logitech webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record PC screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="How to replace and remove the background with Personify ChromaCam software"></a>How to replace and remove the background with <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/" >Personify ChromaCam software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><h3 id="ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam"><a href="#ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam"></a>ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam</h3><p>Before you can start customizing the backgrounds of your webcam videos, there are a few preparation steps you have to take. Currently, Personify ChromaCam is available <strong>only on the Windows operating system,</strong> so Mac users can’t install the software even if they own a Logitech C992 Pro Stream webcam and BRIO 4K Pro Webcam. If you purchased these webcam models, you will be asked if you want to install the Personify ChromaCam software for free when you connect the webcam to a computer for the first time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download the software from the ChromaCam<a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/download/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you are not using the Logitech C922 or BRIO 4K webcam. ChromaCam works with all 2D webcams, but you may need to pay.</p><p>The software’s tech specs are not demanding, but you’ll still need to have <strong>at least Windows 7,</strong> or a more recent version of the Windows OS installed on your PC as well as an Intel or AMD Processor and <strong>4GB of RAM memory.</strong> ChromaCam is <strong>optimized for 64-bit Windows,</strong> although it can work on 32-bit version of the OS, and the software can only be used with processors included in the Intel AVX Set. Personify ChromaCam is compatible with a lot of video chatting apps and broadcasting software products, including Skype, OBS Studio, <a class="link"   href="https://www.xsplit.com/" >XSplit Broadcaster software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (we will take it for example in this article) , Google Hangouts, GameShow or Twitch, to mention a few.</p><p>Regardless of the software, you’re using with ChromaCam, the setup process is fairly simple and it includes only a few easy steps. We are going to show how you can replace and remove backgrounds with Personify ChromaCam using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam" >Logitech C922 Pro Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam.</p><h4 id="Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software"></a>Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software</h4><p>Connect the webcam to your PC, and install the ChromaCam software. If for some reason your Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t provide this option, you can download the software from the<a class="link"   href="http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads" >Logitech’s customer support page. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-c922-chromacam.jpg"                      alt="logitech-c922-chromacam "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BGeneral%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/general-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Personify ChromaCam works as an add-on for screencasting and broadcasting software products, that allows you to select a new background for the webcam video. The background removal and replacement features the ChromaCam offers enable users to combine several sources of videos while broadcasting live on the Internet’s most popular video streaming platforms.</p><p>The free version of ChromaCam adds watermarks to all videos, and you must pay a $29,99 one-time fee to remove them. However, the free version of the software that comes bundled with Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t create watermarks.</p><p>When the ChromaCam software is successfully installed on your PC, and after you’ve made sure that the webcam is working properly, you can launch the XSplit Broadcaster. If you haven’t installed this software on your PC yet, you can click <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/#about" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to start the installation process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/personify-chromacam-remove-background.jpg"                      alt="personify-chromacam-remove-background "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session"><a href="#Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session"></a>Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session</h4><p>Once the XSplit software opens, you should head to the <strong>Add Source</strong> menu, and then select the Personify ChormaCam from the Webcam, capture card, video devices drop-down list. The Personify window will pop-up on the screen, and you’ll be able to select a new background for the webcam video by clicking on the templates featured in the Personify window.</p><p>If you’d like to adjust the video recording settings, you should right-click on the C922 Pro Stream webcam and open the Configure drop-down menu. Select the Video Output feature, and proceed to pick the Color Space Compression, Frame Rato or the Output size. The Video Input option in the Configure menu, grants you access to Logitech’s Camera Settings for the webcam and enables you to activate the Low Light Compensation feature, that improves the C922 Pro Stream’s performance in low-light conditions.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options"><a href="#Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options"></a>Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options</h4><p>In the ChromaCam window, you can select a transparent background option if you would like to blend the figure into the screen recording or some of the template backgrounds that make the narrator stand out against the background. The software allows you to import custom made backgrounds by clicking on the plus icon in the Personify ChromaCam window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromacam-interface.jpg"                      alt="chromacam-interface "                ></p><p>Making sure that the figure in the webcam video is properly cropped is the most important part of the process because badly cropped videos reveal too much of the previous background. The software’s cropping precision is limited, although the Personify ChromaCam provides tools that make the figure’s edges smoother.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam"><a href="#Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam"></a>Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam</h4><p>Before you start a new broadcast or a screen recording by clicking on their icons on the XSplit’s top bar, make sure that you are properly positioned and that the webcam is directed towards you. The Personify ChromaCam focuses on the head and torso of the figure in the video, so try not to move too much. The new background cuts out the parts of the figure that go out into the area of the background that has been replaced or removed, which can produce an awkward visual effect</p><p>You can pause or stop recording with a single click and all you’ll be able to find your videos in the XSplit’s Recordings tab.</p><p>You can also use this software in other screen recording software, please share with us how it works for you in the comment below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-better-background-replacement"><a href="#Tips-for-better-background-replacement" class="headerlink" title="Tips for better background replacement"></a>Tips for better background replacement</h2><p>Changing or removing the background in a webcam video is easy, but there a few things you can do to ensure that all webcam videos created with Personify ChromaCam software meet the highest visual standards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds"><a href="#1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use simple monochrome backgrounds</h3><p>Complex backgrounds that contain a lot of details should be avoided at all cost because the software won’t know which part of the screen you want to replace. A minimalistic, clean working background that doesn’t contain anything that might distract the viewer or the software, will make it easier for the software to place an outline around the figure and separate it from the rest of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png"                      border="0"                >Kanto Player Professional</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality"><a href="#2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find the right balance between the performance and video quality</h3><p>Logitech C922 can capture videos at 60 fps in 720p resolution when used with Personify ChromaCam, but the software also enables you to reduce the screen recording quality you’re producing and increase the quality of the webcam footage. Click on the Setting icon in the Personify window and then just drag the Performance VS Quality slider to improve the quality of the footage produced by ChromaCam. However, lowering the video quality will also decrease the frame rate, so your screen recordings may not be as smooth as they would be if they were captured at the maximum resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment"><a href="#3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment" class="headerlink" title="3.

Use professional lighting equipment</h3><p>Logitech C922 webcam performs remarkably well, even under difficult light conditions, but having enough light in the shot will guarantee that the video meets the conventional quality standards. Webcam videos captured under low-light conditions are often blurry and the person featured in the video is hard to recognize. That’s the reason why you should always strive to have a sufficient amount of light in the webcam video, so the ChromaCam software can easily place an outline around the figure in the video. Using more than one spotlight to light the scene can help you remove the shadows cast by a Persona in the video because shadows can make the background removal software less efficient.</p><p><img

Do you want your screen recorder to record not just your screen but also your webcam with audio? <strong>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10</strong> is a great app available exclusively for Windows users.

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 1. Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade. Even though it is available free of cost, the features and functionalities are enough for high-quality screen recording activity. You can not only record the screen activities but also from the webcam. Moreover, you can record only a selected area of the screen rather than the entire screen. Here is the list of features Screen Recorder Pro has to offer.</p><p><strong>Key Features –</strong></p><ul><li>Record all screen activities on any application.</li><li>Capture screen with or without mouse cursor.</li><li>Record the entire screen or specific area and screen.</li><li>Capture click and keystrokes effectively.</li><li>Record video from webcam with audio.</li><li>Capture audio from microphone as well as speakers.</li><li>Save in different formats like MP4, AVI, and GIF.</li><li>Capture screenshots instead of videos if required.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording. To capture screenshots, you should click on Camera icon located just beside Record button.</p><p>Once the recording is done, click on the same button(Stop icon) to stop recording.</p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Editor’s-Review"><a href="#Part-3-The-Editor’s-Review" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you. The adaptability of OBS Studio answers your demands and enables you to link Zoom with OBS Studio.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Use Roblox Built-In Game Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu. Find and click on the plugin you have downloaded and follow the vizard to replicate OBS output as a virtual camera.</p><p>**<strong>Configure Zoom:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> In Zoom, begin a meeting, then pick a video source. The new option introduced by your OBS plugin will display. Select it and then click on the Start Video option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-zoom.jpg"                      alt="configure zoom"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> The Zoom’s video will now accept the input from the virtual camera, which is the output provided by OBS Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/accept-the-input.jpg"                      alt="accept the input"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Most of you will be on a mobile device and mobile device displays are of a different aspect ratio than your PC. Click on the Profile menu on OBS at the top and click on New Profile and name the Profile as per your convenience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-2"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast.

Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

That’s why your video tutorials need to offer something unique in order to stand out in the sea of similar content. The process of making a tutorial starts long before you hit the record button, and here are a few tips that will help you be prepared for the challenges you might face while making your first video tutorial.</p><h4 id="1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics"><a href="#1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics" class="headerlink" title="1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics"></a>1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics</h4><p>Who are the people you are trying to reach? Finding the answer to this simple question is going to help you solve a variety of common issues video content producers have to deal with. By defining the target audience you’ll be able to discover the best way to approach them.</p><p>What’s more, once you understand who the viewers of your tutorials are, you’ll be able to pick the subjects that spark the most interest within the group you’re targeting. It goes without saying that knowing everything there is to know about the topics you’re covering is an absolute must if you are hoping to attract large audiences to your videos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-a-Content-Plan"><a href="#2-Make-a-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="2. Make a Content Plan"></a>2. Make a Content Plan</h4><p>The best way to approach the process of tutorial video production is to define your goals and the course of action long before you start recording. You should write down all the ideas and concepts you have in your head. Once you’ve formulated the concept you’ll be able to see how many videos you have to make in order to cover all the ins and outs of a topic.</p><p>Try to find natural stopping points or thematic units in your list and decide how many videos you’ll have to create so you can offer a comprehensive and informative view on the subject. Including too much information in one video may discourage the viewers to follow the tutorial until the end. You should take into consideration the concept of the cognitive load while deciding how long your videos should be. This concept points out that there’s a limit to how much and how fast an average person can learn, so offering too much information in a single video can end up being counterproductive.</p><p>If the topic of your video tutorial is complex you should provide explanations through practical examples, even if it takes a lot of screen time, rather than jumping from one subject to another. Here are a few tips that will help you figure out how to structure your video tutorial series.</p><p><strong>Your concept must have a clear beginning, middle and the end:</strong> This is a basic rule of storytelling that helps you guide the viewer through the topic of your tutorials. You should use the same principle when recording each video in the series.</p><p><strong>How much time a certain topic demands:</strong> Covering more than one topic in a video is possible, although before you decide to do so, you should make sure that the topics you want to include in the tutorial have something in common.</p><p><strong>How much information is too much:</strong> Keeping the viewer’s attention glued to what’s going on in the tutorial is your primary goal. That’s why you need to find the right measure of information you provide in each video. By offering less information in each video, you’re giving viewers the time to process it and understand it better.</p><p>Once you’ve created thematic units you can proceed to write a script for each video. These scripts don’t have to be detailed, you can just create a few bullet points to guide you through the video.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in a Clean Work Environment"></a>3. Record in a Clean Work Environment</h4><p>Everything displayed on your computer’s monitor is going to be recorded, so before you start a screen capturing session make sure that all of your private data is well outside the work environment you’ll be using in the video. Instead of wasting time on concealing private information in the post-production, you can save time by controlling what is visible in the portion of the screen you are capturing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making"><a href="#Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Choosing Best Screen Recorder for Video Tutorial Making"></a>Part 2: Choosing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Video Tutorial Making</h2><p>Having the right tools for a job is as equally important as knowing exactly how to do a certain job. There are so many different screen recorders on the market at the moment, that choosing the right one isn’t always such an easy task. Most free software products that offer the screencasting feature have limitations that may prevent you from creating a high-quality tutorial.</p><p>If you want to capture videos at high frame rates, select the region of the screen you’re recording by yourself or record high-resolution footage we recommend using Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Scrn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides featuring powerful screen capturing tools, the software also has a video editing mode, that allows you to edit your videos immediately after you finish a screencasting session. You can use this software to record all your desktop activities on Mac and PC computers for free, and you can purchase the perpetual license to use it for just $29.99 or a one-year license at $19.99.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://funwhole.sjv.io/c/5597632/1702887/17189" target="_top" id="1702887"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1702887"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1702887/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio"></a>Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio</h2><p>Video tutorials largely depend on narration, because you have to use your voice to explain what is going on in the video. That’s why you have to pay special attention to the quality of sound in your videos. Tutorials with poor audio quality have fewer chances of attracting large audiences, simply because most people don’t want to watch a video if they can’t understand what you are saying. Here’s how you can improve the quality of audio in your video tutorials.</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-right-Microphone"><a href="#1-Use-the-right-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the right Microphone"></a>1. Use the right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Whether or not you should record audio with an external microphone is not the real question you should be asking. The real issue is which type of external microphone you should use. Omnidirectional microphones pick up background noises easily, so in order to record clear and natural narration, you should use a unidirectional microphone that only picks up sounds that are coming from one direction.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary"><a href="#2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary" class="headerlink" title="2.Add Background Music if necessary"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary</h4><p>Music can help you create a pleasant atmosphere in your video tutorials and it can partially cover the background noise. There are numerous websites that grant you access to royalty free music, which means that it shouldn’t be too hard to find the track you want to include in the tutorial. You should just make sure that the voiceover is clearly audible because you don’t want the music to be louder than the narrator’s voice.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment"></a>3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment</h4><p>Sometimes background noise can completely destroy the audio recording you captured. So, in order to avoid this turn off all home appliances that create atmospheric noises. In addition, the room in which you are recording should have great acoustics, because even the slightest reverb can influence the sound quality.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial"></a>Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial</h2><p>Note: There are so many screen recording software available on the market as we described before. But here, we will take Filmora Scrn as an example.</p><p>Once you’ve prepared a clean working environment, attached the external microphone to your computer, it is time to start your first screencasting session. You can begin by launching <strong>Filmora Scrn</strong> and selecting the <strong>Quick Capture</strong> option from the software’s welcome window.</p><h4 id="1-Designate-the-region-of-the-screen-you’d-like-to-capture"><a href="#1-Designate-the-region-of-the-screen-you’d-like-to-capture" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can easily solve this problem by speeding up portions of the video that don’t contain vital information. Just click on the clip on the timeline to select it and head over to the Transform menu on the right side of the Filmora Scrn’s editor.

Where to upload a video tutorial?"></a>1. Where to upload a video tutorial?</h4><p>The most obvious choice is YouTube because it is the world’s largest video sharing platform. However, options such as Vimeo or even Facebook may produce equally impressive results. The eLearning websites, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Udemy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or <a class="link"   href="https://www.skillshare.com/" >Skillshare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are also worth considering if your plan is to produce video tutorials on a professional level.</p><h4 id="2-Optimize-the-video-description"><a href="#2-Optimize-the-video-description" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize the video description"></a>2. Optimize the video description</h4><p>Using keywords in the video description will secure better search results. Choose keywords that are directly related to the topic your video is covering, because you will gain nothing if the video appears in search results for unrelated subjects. There are a lot of different tools online you can use to discover the best keywords for your video tutorials, including the Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool.</p><h4 id="3-Write-a-related-blog-post"><a href="#3-Write-a-related-blog-post" class="headerlink" title="3. Write a related blog post"></a>3. Write a related blog post</h4><p>One of the best ways to promote your video tutorials is to write blogs about the topics you are covering because you can use the videos to offer more info about the subject. That way you’ll direct readers towards the tutorial and you’ll be able to generate more traffic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072199/17885" target="_top" id="2072199"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072199"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072199/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial"></a>Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial</h2><p>Don’t expect your first video tutorial to be a major success, that’s going to attract millions of views. But what you can do is keep track of the number of hits the video got, pay attention to the comments, suggestions or critique and try to do better in the next video. There are many different tools you can use to monitor a video’s performance, including YouTube Analytics if you’re using this platform.</p><p>Developing your video making skills and using the feedback you get to increase the quality of the content you’re producing is probably the most important aspect of the entire process. Failing to find ways to improve the video tutorials you’re making may result in a low number of views and their overall poor performance on the Internet, so you should do everything in your power to constantly find new ways of reaching new audiences and delivering high-quality tutorials to your audience.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The process of creating a video tutorial is rather simple since you only have to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture, make sure that the microphone is functioning properly and hit the record button. The Internet offers plenty of opportunities to share your work with millions of people and to help them learn new skills or solve problems that are preventing them from moving forward in their careers.

From the makers of Citra, one of the most popular 3DS emulators comes this free and open-source emulator. The emulator runs on C++ and is designed to emulate the Nintendo Switch’s essential hardware components. function. Some games have problems with this, which is one of the reasons the performance in certain titles is less than ideal.</p><p>Despite the lack of power, Yuzu managed to run Super Mario Odyssey at a frame rate comparable to the Switchback in 2019.

Aside from these advantages, the Ryujinx emulator is easy to use and can run games at 60fps.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Survival-of-the-Undead-Cutthroat-Top-8-Zombie-Titles"><a href="#Survival-of-the-Undead-Cutthroat-Top-8-Zombie-Titles" class="headerlink" title="Survival of the Undead: Cutthroat Top 8 Zombie Titles"></a>Survival of the Undead: Cutthroat Top 8 Zombie Titles</h2><p>Which zombie games are the best for PC? It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps. Just make sure you don’t get a monster head caught in your wipers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4559731&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.neowise.com/images/nd-ss-w200.jpg"                      border="0"                >NeoDownloader - Fast and fully automatic image&#x2F;video&#x2F;music downloader. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-State-of-the-Decay-2"><a href="#3-State-of-the-Decay-2" class="headerlink" title="3.State of the Decay 2"></a>3.State of the Decay 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/state-of-the-decay-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="state-of-the-decay-2-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116"                      border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Unlike Project Zomboid, which concentrates primarily on the concept of being an ordinary person in an unfair position, the States of Decay series tries to keep you amused with the beautiful midwestern countryside and Gorey entertaining combat even while your supplies run out and zombies smash down your gate.</p><p>The introduction of multiplayer in States of Decay 2 is probably the most intriguing new feature. Inviting people to help protect and hunt for your village greatly expands the scope of procedurally produced tales. It also enables you to put to the test all of those zombie outbreak survival tactics you’ve spent way too much time talking with your pals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901369&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix 4K - Software based live production. vMix 4K includes everything in vMix HD plus 4K support, PTZ control, External&#x2F;Fullscreen output, 4 Virtual Outputs, 1 Replay, 4 vMix Call, and 2 Recorders.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019"><a href="#4-Resident-Evil-2-remake-of-2019" class="headerlink" title="4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)"></a>4.Resident Evil 2 (remake of 2019)</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resident-evil-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="resident-evil-2-poster"                ></p><p>Resident Evil 2’s sequel treads a thin line between the sluggish horror of the original Resident Evil game and the quicker (but still methodical) action of the post-Resident Evil 7 period. It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge. You’ll make choices that will have significant repercussions for your group members when you meet more survivors. The worst part is that you develop feelings for the people in your group. As a consequence, when bad things happen, you’ll feel as though you’ve just seen a real-life buddy being eaten rather than a video game character. People will die, unexpected events will occur, and choices will need to be made. You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.revouninstaller.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=27889512&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4282ec8de8c9be897e7aff4aa231b1a4/728__90.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety.

It succeeds in being both a worthy homage to the first Resident Evil 2 and the most important, playable RE games in years as a result of this. The key is the zombies, as you’d expect from a game that ranks among the zombie games. Even while the remake’s mobility and shooting controls seem to be more contemporary and streamlined, each zombie can only take so many shots - even headshot - before resurrecting. Even immediately in front of your eyes, or perhaps a few minutes later, when you believe you are secure.</p><p>In the remake of Resident Evil 2, the perfect aim isn’t enough to ensure your life. The most essential element is caution since you save ammunition by firing to stun rather than kill. You could even decide the zombies can take the passageway while you retain the ammunition. It’s still not as terrifying as the other major Resident Evil remake in terms of sheer dread. However, the Resident Evil 2’s remake is undoubtedly more enjoyable to play, earning it a place on our list of zombie games.</p><h3 id="5-The-Walking-Dead-1"><a href="#5-The-Walking-Dead-1" class="headerlink" title="5.The Walking Dead"></a>5.The Walking Dead</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-walking-dead-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-walking-dead-poster"                ></p><p>You play Lee Everett, a convicted murderer who takes in an orphaned young girl called Clementine as his charge.

Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later.

It sends you on a perilous cross-country journey across a largely post-human America. The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying.

It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun.

You’ll have to live with the repercussions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-2"><a href="#6-The-HD-Remaster-of-Resident-Evil-2" class="headerlink" title="6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil"></a>6.The HD Remaster of Resident Evil</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remaster-of-resident-evil-poster.png"                      alt="remaster-of-resident-evil-poster"                ></p><p>The utter loneliness of becoming one of the last humans with a heartbeat within some several-mile radius is something that the first Resident Evil gets right that many zombie games miss out on. Resident Evil High-Definition Remaster is a somewhat updated version of Resident Evil GameCube update from 2002, maintaining the terrible desolation in its entirety. Don’t get us wrong: the 2015 remake should have done a lot more (those pre-rendered backdrops are starting to seem a little fuzzy these days), but what’s there is still a landmark survival horror classic.</p><p>The Resident Evil update isn’t just one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective on the undead; it’s one of the best zombie games because of its unique perspective what to do, in particular, with one that seems to have ceased to move. You would like to make sure you put zombies down with just a headshot or burn their bodies afterward because if you don’t, the monster known as a “crimson head” will spring up later. Shivers go down your spine just uttering the word.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-The-Last-of-Us-3"><a href="#7-The-Last-of-Us-3" class="headerlink" title="7.The Last of Us"></a>7.The Last of Us</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-last-of-us-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-last-of-us-poster"                ></p><p>The Last of Us, which won the game of Year in 2013, is still the best zombie game ever made over six years later.

The planet is filled with desperate weapon survivalists, a totalitarian government, and violent rebel groups, apart from mushroom-brained undead with fangs eager to tear your jugular out. The greatest part is that you have to do it all with a sassy young woman who alternates between making fun of you and rescuing your life.</p><p>The journey of Joel and Ellie would be both dark and terrifying.

It can be done, we promise! We took a look to try and explain this one a little further after we found out that not everyone knows how it all works.</p><p>WhatsApp is one of our favorite communication apps, especially useful while we are all stuck at home in shelter of the virus.

Most people have Facebook, it will work with all their products, and it is as easy to join as clicking a link. The downside is that it only works if FB knows who you are.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay.

In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4. Best Alternative"></a>4. Best Alternative</h2><p>If you are looking for a better alternative to SplitCam after not being satisfied with its features and functionalities, we recommend you opt for Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, it fails to produce the output as a professional-quality video recorder. You cannot record video in 4K resolution and SplitCam lacks editing options after recording.

However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027209/17108" target="_top" id="2027209"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2027209"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2027209/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863039/11832" target="_top" id="863039"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863039"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.
