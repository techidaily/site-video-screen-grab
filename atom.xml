Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137972/21526" target="_top" id="2137972">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137972" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137972/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118319/7443" target="_top" id="2118319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean. Though some players do not want to bother themselves with sailing, the ideal seed for you will be oV5BZHkqY4.</p><h3 id="4-Seed-maypoleplz"><a href="#4-Seed-maypoleplz" class="headerlink" title="4.Seed: maypoleplz"></a>4.Seed: maypoleplz</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-4.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-4"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In such a game that concentrates on surviving and crafting, all the help you need will be gotten.

It is furniture that is made available only to some Valheim world seeds. The players themselves cannot craft these Valheim seeds.</p><p>With the seed mapoleplz, you will be capable of spawning in a world that has Maypole lying towards the west. It simply means that if you construct a base around the structure, your character will be getting extra comfort when resting here.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144276/7443" target="_top" id="2144276">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144276" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144276/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk"><a href="#5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk" class="headerlink" title="5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk"></a>5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-5.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-5"                ></p><p>Since Iron is among the best resources one can find in the Valheim game, it must be understood that it is hard to come by. There are so many things the players will need to do to access Iron.</p><p> <em>“Note: Iron is made available only in the Swamp biome. ”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, immediately you unlock the scrap Iron, you can quickly drop it in the smelter to process Iron. Then, you can begin creating weapons and your armor. More so, for those interested in Iron farming, seed t9n3WG6dFk is among the Valheim seeds that have a vast Swamp biome wholly filled with sunken crypts. You can easily explore these crypts and the muddy scrap piles that are prepared to be mined. Bear in mind that before you get to work, ensure that your wishbone is equipped. The wishbone will help in quickly finding the muddy scrap piles.</p><h3 id="6-Seed-42069lolxd"><a href="#6-Seed-42069lolxd" class="headerlink" title="6.Seed: 42069lolxd"></a>6.Seed: 42069lolxd</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-6.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-6"                ></p><p>For those unaware, Haldor is a merchant of Valheim. When searching for the best Valheim seeds, this is the ideal seed you will need if you want to trade with Haldor. With this seed, you will be in a world where Haldor is very close to the point of spawning. You just need to head towards the east from the spawn point and follow the south coast. Then, you are to cross the water until you arrive at the black forest biome. When you find Haldor, you can use your coins to buy items like a yule hat, fishing rod, and anything else.</p><p>You can sell things to Haldor as well.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visualize-your-movies-with-best-grabbers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Visualize Your Movies with Best Grabbers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/2024-approved-compelling-choices-macs-excellent-snipping-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Compelling Choices Mac's Excellent Snipping Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-track-oppo-find-n3-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Track Oppo Find N3 without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/comprehensible-list-best-games-music-found-online-for-2024/"><u>Comprehensible List Best Games’ Music Found Online for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-cant-take-screenshot-due-to-security-policy-on-honor-90-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Cant Take Screenshot Due to Security Policy on Honor 90 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/highlighting-the-best-ios-psp-emulators-1-5-for-2024/"><u>Highlighting the Best iOS PSP Emulators #1-5 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-advanced-strategies-for-recording-and-saving-gameplay-on-ps4/"><u>In 2024, Advanced Strategies for Recording and Saving Gameplay on PS4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-poco-c55-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Sim Unlock Poco C55 Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-tips-of-transferring-messages-from-infinix-smart-7-hd-to-iphone-1415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, Tips of Transferring Messages from Infinix Smart 7 HD to iPhone 14/15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-tutorials.techidaily.com/mp4-vs-mkv-comprehensive-guide-on-choosing-the-right-video-format/"><u>MP4 Vs.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Open-Broadcasters-Versus-ShadowReplay"><a href="#Open-Broadcasters-Versus-ShadowReplay" class="headerlink" title="Open Broadcasters Versus ShadowReplay"></a>Open Broadcasters Versus ShadowReplay</h2><p>If you are an avid gamer and you are not recording your gameplay and uploading on online platforms, you are missing out on the trend. Gamers are uploading their gameplay on video streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube and earning followers, fame as well as money. No matter which game you play on your computer, you should record it. Thereafter, you can make it interesting with editing and voiceover and upload on video streaming and social media platforms.</p><p>Primarily, you will need a gameplay recording software and there is no dearth of gameplay and screen recording software. The two most popular free gameplay recorders are OBS Studio and ShadowPlay. In order to help you choose OBS or ShadowPlay, we have provided you with a complete comparison of ShadowPlay vs OBS recording software. Go through all the points minutely and understand their differences and pick the perfect one for recording your gameplay.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-OBS-and-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay"></a>Part 1. Key Features of OBS and ShadowPlay</h2><p>OBS and ShadowPlay are both completely free to use for recording your gameplay as well as your capturing desktop screen. OBS is open-source software and it has a cross-platform structure which is why it supports all computer operating systems. It is popular among gamers for live streaming on Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>ShadowPlay comes from Nvidia which is the largest manufacturer for GPU. That is why gamers who prefer Nvidia GPU, they have a special preference for ShadowPlay. Here are the key features of OBS and ShadowPlay you should be aware of.</p><h3 id="OBS-Studio"><a href="#OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="OBS Studio"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-sims4-obs.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p><strong>Screen Capture</strong> - You can capture high-quality gameplay when you play games on your computer as well as on a gaming console. You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction. It has advanced filters that enable Chroma keying, image masking, and color correction.</p><p><strong>Easy Switching</strong> - It comes with a one-click solution for switching between transitions and scenes. The tool can be perfect for going back and forth between games and devices. You can also add multiple screens and audio sources as required.</p><p>Most importantly, you can live stream your gameplay on almost any online video streaming platform.</p><h3 id="Nvidia-ShadowPlay"><a href="#Nvidia-ShadowPlay" class="headerlink" title="Nvidia ShadowPlay"></a>Nvidia ShadowPlay</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay"                ></p><p><strong>Gameplay Capture</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you record gameplay at 8K with 30FPS. This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

For not so high-end games, OBS does the job perfectly. OBS is particularly useful when you want to live stream as well as record your gameplay. If you are looking for a premium software and a better alternative, Wondershare Filmora is the perfect choice.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-10-exceptional-educational-sites-a-look-without-udemy/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 10 Exceptional Educational Sites A Look without Udemy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-assessing-sns-hdr-pro-habits-and-alternative-options/"><u>[New] Assessing SNS HDR Pro’ Habits & Alternative Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-from-the-grave-to-gameplay-top-8-zombies-unleashed/"><u>[New] From the Grave to Gameplay Top 8 Zombies Unleashed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/n-2024-economical-camera-options-best-deals-for-diy-vloggers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Economical Camera Options Best Deals for DIY Vloggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-integrating-your-vimeo-videos-into-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, Integrating Your Vimeo Videos Into Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-farm-management-mastery-for-stardews-ginger-isles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Farm Management Mastery for Stardew's Ginger Isles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-analysis-logitechs-4k-professional-cam-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Analysis Logitech's 4K Professional Cam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-add-and-record-audio-to-powerpoint/"><u>2024 Approved Add & Record Audio to PowerPoint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-investigating-the-realm-of-virtual-sticker-decoration/"><u>2024 Approved Investigating the Realm of Virtual Sticker Decoration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/advanced-tips-for-capturing-iphone-7-content-for-2024/"><u>Advanced Tips for Capturing iPhone 7 Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-the-soft-bricked-nokia-c32-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Fix the Soft Bricked Nokia C32? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-contacts-from-infinix-zero-30-5g-to-iphone-xs11-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Contacts from Infinix Zero 30 5G to iPhone XS/11 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/navigating-through-the-best-tools-to-monitor-instagram-metrics-effectively/"><u>Navigating Through the Best Tools to Monitor Instagram Metrics Effectively</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This information will make your task easier:</p><h4 id="1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10"><a href="#1-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-Game-Bar-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10"></a>1. Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys. As soon as the Game Bar is open on your screen, hit the camera shaped button available on the bar; it is named “Screenshot.”</p><p>In case if you find it little difficult to open your game bar using these keys in between a game; Windows 10 also allows users to customize these keys as per their convenience. You can alter the shortcut keys by switching to Settings, then Gaming and finally Game Bar. As soon as you capture a screenshot using Game Bar, the system shows an instant notification “Screenshot saved,” it appears on the bottom right corner of the screen. All these screenshots are automatically saved at Captures&#x2F; Videos section along with all other videos that you have captured till now using Windows 10 Game Bar feature.</p><h4 id="2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts"><a href="#2-Taking-Screenshots-Using-In-Game-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts"></a>2. Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts</h4><p>In case if you are not playing games on Steam, it is still possible to capture screenshots with many built-in shortcuts and screenshot functions. In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture. As soon as you tap the key in question, the game will instantly save a screenshot at a specific location on the disk. For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut"></a>3. Taking Screenshots Using Steam’s Shortcut</h4><p>In case if you are playing your favorite game on Steam, it is possible to capture screenshots instantly by using the built-in screen capture feature of Steam. The great news is that capturing a screenshot with Steam is quite easier; you simply need to hit “F12” key on your keyboard. As soon as you press the key, a shutter sound will be heard on the system and a notification saying “Screenshot Saved” will appear instantly on the bottom right corner of PC screen.</p><p>In case if you do not find F12 key easier to access during your games, you can also customize this key by going to Steam Interface section. Go to settings and then In-Game and finally adjust the “Screenshot Shortcut Keys” option as per your requirement. If you want to view the captured screenshots, open them using Shift + Tab key on Steam Overlay; or if you have altered the settings on Steam, it can be done using your custom shortcut on the keyboard. Finally, click “View Screenshots” button on the overlay.</p><p>If you want to see your screenshots after exiting the game, you will find them on Steam library by opening game page. Simply scroll down towards bottom area of your game’s page, and the screenshots will be available with a “View Screenshot Library” option. You will be happy to know that it is possible to upload captured screenshots directly to Facebook using screenshot library. You can also find your captured screenshots using “Show on Disk” button.</p><h4 id="4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience"><a href="#4-Capturing-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-GeForce-Experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience"></a>4. Capturing Screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience</h4><p>In case if you are working with Nvidia graphics, the chances are that your system also has Nvidia’s GeForce Experience software. This software tool is loaded with wide range of features and the screenshot capturing ability is one of them. In order to capture a game screenshot with Nvidia GeForce Experience, simply hit Alt + F1 key and the screenshot will get automatically saved into GeForce Experience Gallery. As soon as the screenshot is captured, the system also displays an instant notification about it saying “Screenshot has been saved to Gallery” on the top right side of your screen.</p><p>In order to view the captured screenshots, you can press Alt + Z button on your Windows system. Go to Gallery to view all your game screenshots; note that they will be saved along with the ShadowPlay Videos on your system. These screenshots can also be found under Videos\Name of the Game path along with videos that you have captured using GeForce Experience.</p><h4 id="5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel"><a href="#5-Taking-Screenshot-with-Nvidia-Ansel" class="headerlink" title="5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel"></a>5. Taking Screenshot with Nvidia Ansel</h4><p>There is no doubt to say that GeForce Experience provides a rich experience with its awesome features but here is another tool from Nvidia that can also help you to capture screenshots; however, it allows users to capture them using moving camera. Note that, this option works only with few specific games, only if the developer has added support for this feature. However, there are many popular games in the list that support Nvidia Ansel feature like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, etc.</p><p>When you are playing the game, simply hit Alt + F2 key and the gameplay will instantly freeze; along with this, “Ansel” sidebar will appear on the screen. Now you can adjust the screen for capturing region specific screenshot using drag and drop feature of a mouse or with the help of keyboard keys. In case if you are interested in adding a unique filter effect to your screenshot, it can be done by using various options available on the sidebar; gamers love to use sepia tone or wish to adjust the field of view for their captured shots. You can also make selections for whether you want to capture your game screenshots with a normal view or need super-resolution. Some of you may also be interested in capturing a 360-degree screenshot with Nvidia Ansel. These 360-degree screenshots can be later viewed via different methods like HTC Vive, Oculus Rift or using Google Cardboard Headset.</p><p>Hit the snap button, and your screenshots will be saved instantly; this system allows you to capture an unlimited number of shots with the paused screen. You can later view these screenshots by pressing Alt + Z key on your system or by simply clicking “Gallery” option. These screenshots are generally saved at Videos\Name of the Game path.</p><h4 id="6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature"><a href="#6-Taking-Game-Screenshots-with-AMD-ReLive-Feature" class="headerlink" title="6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature"></a>6. Taking Game Screenshots with AMD ReLive Feature</h4><p>In case if you are working on AMD graphics hardware, you can capture screenshots with the help of its ReLive Feature. Note that, this feature works only if you are using a desktop with AMD Graphics Core Next Architecture. However, it is not so fancy like Nvidia Ansel; the screen capture option is almost same as Steam or the Nvidia GeForce Experience. As soon as you are ready with ReLive, simply hit Ctrl + Shift + E button or use Alt + Z. Now click on the “Screenshot” option to capture the screenshot from your favorite game. It will be saved by default into videos folder on your system. You can share these screenshots later with your friends online to showcase your gaming adventure.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Being a dedicated and crazy gamer, you may always be interested in sharing your gaming experiences with your friends online.

Its features, such as a built-in recorder and separate audio tracks for each speaker, make it great for podcasting. But you can’t use it for professional purposes because it compresses the audio files and reduces their quality.</p><h3 id="3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-do-I-host-a-podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3.

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better.

The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Multiple platforms are supported, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li><li>As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.</li><li>In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Matsu-Emulator"><a href="#2-Matsu-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="2.Matsu Emulator"></a>2.Matsu Emulator</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png"                      alt="matsu-emulator-ps1"                ></p><p>There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX&#x2F;PSOne platform.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam. You may select “Start Streaming” if you need to webcast the conference elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-streaming.jpg"                      alt="start streaming"                ></p><p>If you wish to put yourself into the Stream from your PC associated webcam or other video devices linked, utilize the Video Source Option instead of Window Capture and specify your target device when adding the source. Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic&#x2F;Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this. Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Zoom and OBS. In OBS, under “Sources,” click the Plus button and choose “Display Capture.” This will work best if you have more than one monitor for your PC, but it will still operate if you just have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-zomm-meetings.jpg"                      alt="record zoom meetings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You may use the “Window Capture” option and pick “Zoom.exe” as your source, although this might not always work. Name the capture anything you wish, then click “OK.” You may use the name of the monitor you’re using for Zoom to keep things simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg"                      alt="window capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> In OBS, click on “+” under “Sources” again, then pick “Audio Input Capture.” Rename the capture source if you wish to keep it distinct from the other source and prevent misunderstanding, then hit “OK.” Press “Start Recording.” Maximize Zoom to full-screen mode to make it the only visible application on display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-input-capture.jpg"                      alt="audio input capture"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>OBS enables recording into several video formats. But the major reason why you may want to learn how to record Zoom meetings using OBS is that the software may help firms gain a step ahead on their video production. OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam.

Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic&#x2F;Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037346/7443" target="_top" id="2037346">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037346" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037346/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project.

The same shortcut can be used to stop recording. All videos will be saved in the same destination folder named Video&#x2F;Capture, and the app won’t let you change this setting.</p><p>However, the DVR feature in Xbox app will allow you to choose the duration of your video or increase the quality of the video you’re recording but the mouse cursor will not be recorded.

However, there is a lot to consider before choosing your camera.</p><p>This guide critiques and ranks the best gaming webcams to make that choice easier. Some webcams provide great value, while others deliver an unbelievable high-resolution streaming experience. The following are some of the features we looked for in creating this guide:</p><h2 id="What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams"><a href="#What-to-Look-for-in-Gaming-Webcams" class="headerlink" title="What to Look for in Gaming Webcams"></a>What to Look for in Gaming Webcams</h2><ul><li>Video quality</li><li>Resolution</li><li>Microphone quality</li><li>Price</li><li>Low-light capabilities</li></ul><h2 id="Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have"><a href="#Our-Ideal-Gaming-Webcam-Would-Have" class="headerlink" title="Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have"></a>Our Ideal Gaming Webcam Would Have</h2><ul><li>1080p resolution</li><li>60FPS</li><li>Stereo Audio</li><li>Ergonomic design</li><li>RealSense capabilities</li><li>Automatic light correction</li><li>Compatibility with both Windows and Mac</li></ul><p>So, without further ado, the following are our 5 favorite webcams for gaming in 2021:</p><h4 id="1-Ontop-HD-Webcam"><a href="#1-Ontop-HD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has a <strong>6-element glass lens</strong> and delivers <strong>1080p at an admirable 30 FPS</strong>. It also has <strong>automatic low-light correction</strong>, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.</p><p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It delivers tremendous <strong>4K Ultra HD recording</strong>, allowing streamers to produce professional-quality videos. The BRIO is capable of shooting in 3,840 x 2,160 at 30 FPS (Ultra HD), 1,920 x 1,080 at 30 or 60 FPS (Full HD) and 1,280 x 720 at 30 or 60 FPS (HD).</p><p>The BRIO is also packed with additional features such as <strong>5x digital zoom</strong>, <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>omnidirectional mics</strong>. It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The <strong>ring-light camera</strong> is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with <strong>12 different brightness settings,</strong> so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.</p><p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With <strong>1080p full HD video at 30 FPS</strong>, on a <strong>2-megapixel base</strong> and <strong>built-in stereo microphones</strong>, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.</p><p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio.

So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151854/7443" target="_top" id="2151854">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151854" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151854/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.
