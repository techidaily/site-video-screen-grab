This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?"></a>1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?</h3><p>As it is with most social media platforms these days, even in Zoom chat, you can use the @ sign followed by the starting few characters of the person you want to mention. When you start typing, a list of participants with the matching names would appear, and you can then choose the one you want to mention.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements"><a href="#2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Send Chat Announcements?"></a>2. How to Send Chat Announcements?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Configuring and using the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature is <strong>only available for the paid members.</strong></p><p>The process of sending chat announcements with Zoom can be completed in three steps that are discussed below. While the first two steps explain how to enable the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature and add the users who can send or receive announcements, the third step teaches how to send announcements to all the users you added.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Announcements"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Announcements"></a>Step 1: Enable Announcements</h4><p>Launch your favorite browser, sign in to the web portal of your Zoom account, go to <strong>Account Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Visibility</strong> and then turn on the <strong>Announcements</strong> switch.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Users for Announcements"></a>Step 2: Add Users for Announcements</h4><p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon, in the available field type the email address(es) of the user(s) you want to allow to send or receive the announcements and click <strong>Add</strong> to add the participant(s) once found. Next, you can now safely sign out of the web portal of your Zoom account, and proceed to the next step.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Send-Announcements"><a href="#Step-3-Send-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Send Announcements"></a>Step 3: Send Announcements</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Announcements"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=11224199&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/copy_boxshot_lyricvideo.png"                      border="0"                >Lyric Video Creator Professional Version</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Launch Zoom app and sign into your account.

What File Types Does Zoom Chat Support?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Restricting file types and configuring other options granularly can only be done if you have purchased a paid subscription plan.</p><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>Zoom chat</strong> supports almost all types of files. However, by signing in to your account on Zoom’s web portal, you can restrict them by their extensions. For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2201613&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.macdvdripperpro.com/images/devices-3.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats"></a>Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats</h2><p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42570605&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/usbXcopy/Nero_USB_x_copy_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-proven-mac-imaging-comprerante-and-comparing-5-efficient-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Proven Mac Imaging  Comprerante & Comparing 5 Efficient Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-bestiary-of-ios-ps2-game-simulators-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bestiary of iOS PS2 Game Simulators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-5-best-android-software-for-ps2-games-for-2024/"><u>[New] Discover the 5 Best Android Software for PS2 Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-hidden-melodic-markers-ios-and-android-recording-app-overview/"><u>[New] Hidden Melodic Markers  IOS & Android Recording App Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-easycapture-pro-free-for-windows-10/"><u>[New] In 2024, EasyCapture Pro -

It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892107/21290" target="_top" id="1892107"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892107"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892107/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project.

Organizing footage and knowing exactly where a certain shot is in that sea of unsorted material will increase your efficiency during the post-production period, thus enabling you to shorten the amount of time you have to spend editing it.</p><p>Markers can be used during the video editing and after the screen recording to make post-production, to help you mark the places in the footage where you’ve made a mistake, where the new take starts or to indicate a spot on the timeline where you would like to place a particular video clip. In this article, we are going to show you how to utilize markers during the screen capturing sessions or while you’re <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >editing videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record desktop screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Distinctions-Between-the-Two-Types-of-Markers"><a href="#Distinctions-Between-the-Two-Types-of-Markers" class="headerlink" title="Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers"></a>Distinctions Between the Two Types of Markers</h2><p>Watching the footage you’ve captured over and over can be a tiresome process that consumes both time and energy, so in order to increase your efficiency during the process of capturing and editing videos, you can simply add markers both to the files you’re creating while recording or to your project’s timeline.</p><p>The <strong>media markers</strong> are the markers you can add directly to the video file you are creating with Filmora during the screen recording session. You won’t be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software’s video editor and placed on the timeline.</p><p>You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you’re not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you’ve created with Wondershare’s screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you’ll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Markers"                ></p><p>The <strong>timeline markers</strong>, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you’ve completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you’d like to switch from one take to another.</p><p>This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you’re using as a soundtrack to your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?"></a>How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">1.

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you.

How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS<p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam. You may select “Start Streaming” if you need to webcast the conference elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-streaming.jpg"                      alt="start streaming"                ></p><p>If you wish to put yourself into the Stream from your PC associated webcam or other video devices linked, utilize the Video Source Option instead of Window Capture and specify your target device when adding the source. Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic&#x2F;Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu.

The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system.

The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device.

The TV schedule doesn’t wait for us, regardless of how much we would like to watch the latest episode of a popular TV series or the TV premiere of the latest Marvel movie.</p><p>All of this can be easily avoided with a piece of equipment that enables you to record TV shows on your Windows PC or your laptop. If you were trying to find a way to record live TV shows from a computer, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we will take you through all the steps you need to take in order to start recording TV shows on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Pay-Attention-to-Copyright"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Copyright"></a>Pay Attention to Copyright</h2><p>Supporting piracy is illegal, we don’t support it and we have no desire to promote it in this article.

You will still need the proper hardware and software in order to be able to connect your TV, Tivo game console, or any other source of video and your PC or laptop. Keep in mind that you’ll also need a sufficient amount of data storage space if you want to record entire movies or TV shows from your PC. OK, let’s dive into what you will need to record a TV show from your PC right now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card"><a href="#1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="1. HD-PVR or Capture Card"></a>1. HD-PVR or Capture Card</h3><p>These two components are the essential part of the setup you’ll need to record live TV on your PC. Although they basically do the same thing, which is to enable you to transfer the video or TV signal to the computer you are using to record the footage, there are some considerable differences between these two devices. To help you understand it, we have made a detailed explanation below based on our research. So you can choose the Capture Card or HD-PVR based on your situation correctly.</p><h4 id="Capture-Card"><a href="#Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Capture Card"></a>Capture Card</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-card-recording-tv.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Capture Card"                ></p><p>A capture card is a great choice for all PC users who don’t care too much about the quality of the footage they are recording. The device needs to be connected to a TV or a gaming console with component cables, while a free USB slot is needed in order to connect a capture card to your computer.</p><p>The price of capture cards usually varies from $50 for entry-level options to $150 for high-end devices, which makes it more affordable than its alternative, the HD-PVR. Capture cards often come equipped with its own video recording software. However, some of them don’t offer a video recording software capable of high performances, and for that reason, you must do a thorough research before you decide which capture card you want to buy. If you want to get an in-deep understanding of capture card, you can check this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Complete Introduction to Capture Card <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find out more about the best capture cards that are currently available on the market.</p><h4 id="HD-PVR"><a href="#HD-PVR" class="headerlink" title="HD-PVR"></a>HD-PVR</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hd-pvr-tv-recording.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with HD PVR devices"                ></p><p>The more powerful, but more expensive option for recording live TV from a PC is called HD-PVR or High Definition Personal Video Recorder, a box-shaped device that enables you to create near perfect video recordings of your favorite TV shows. The average price of an HD-PVR is approximately $200, even though high-end models can be even more expensive.</p><p>Most HD-PVR models feature their own video recording software, so you won’t have to spend additional money on the software you need to record a TV show from on a PC. Even if you don’t have an HD-PVR with its own built-in video recording software, obtaining a program that will enable you to record videos from a PC shouldn’t be too hard to find.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Component-Cables"><a href="#2-Component-Cables" class="headerlink" title="2. Component Cables"></a>2. Component Cables</h3><p>The trouble with component cables is that they often must be purchased separately since most HD-PVR or capture cards manufacturers don’t include all the cables users need to connect a device to a TV and a computer. In most cases, you’ll just need a set of RCA cables, with ordinary red, yellow and white plugs to connect the capture card or an HD-PVR device to a TV. A simple USB cable can be used to establish a connection between a PC and the device you intend to use to record a TV show or any other TV-based video content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40085955&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f702defbc67edb455949f46babab0c18/products/2_logo9.png"                      border="0"                >FX PRO (Gold Robot + Silver Robot(Basic Package))</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Video-Recording-Software"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording Software"></a>3. Video Recording Software</h3><p>You don’t have to worry if you were unlucky enough to get a capture card or HD-PVR that doesn’t have a built-in video recording software because the video recording software you can use to record TV shows from a PC are fairly common and easy to come by. Furthermore, all recent versions of the Windows OS, up until Windows 7 also provide ways to record live TV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tv-with-windows-media-center.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Windows Media Center"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Windows Media Center is the key entertainment feature on Windows 7 that enables its users to record TV shows, schedule recording sessions and watch the recorded videos from desktop and laptop computers. However, the Windows Media Center is not on the list of built-in features on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, but the software can be easily purchased and downloaded from the Microsoft’s website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-dvr-xbox.jpg"                      alt="Windows 10 Game DVR to Record TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>PC owners that have Windows 10 installed on their computers are probably better off using software like Xbox Game DVR, simply because downloading the Windows Media Center may prevent them from getting the system updates in the future.
