Netflix is a streaming service that allows you to subscribe and view movies and TV episodes on your internet-connected devices. With over 222 million customers by the start of 2022, Netflix is likely one of the most popular video streaming services. Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone’s favorite and we can’t get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.</p><p>When you go on a vacation and don’t have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there’s always the issue of whether or not it’s legal. In most cases, the term “illegal” is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won’t be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix"><a href="#Method-1-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Netflix" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix"></a>Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix</h2><p>You may use the QuickTime Player to record Netflix episodes on your Mac.

It also enables users to utilize hotkeys during capturing to make pausing, restarting, and stopping the recording process simpler. QuickTime Player is a built-in media player for Mac OS X that allows you to watch videos on your computer. With its screen recording capability, Mac users may easily use it as a YouTube video recorder.

The controller has an excellent battery life, very accurate analog sticks, and large buttons more substantial than those on the Switch joy cons. Especially if you’ve been using an Xbox 360 controller for a while and are ready to upgrade, it’s an excellent choice for your next PC controller.</p><p>Utilizing the Nintendo Switch Pro controller for most of your PC games is a breeze thanks to Steam’s controller configurator, which officially supports this controller. Plug-and-play is the most accurate description. To play games, not on Steam, you need to use this guide.</p><p>This article will tell you how to enable your Nintendo Switch Pro controller to work with Steam or Windows, either through a Bluetooth connection or a wired connection. The first thing you’ll need is a Nintendo Switch Pro controller (obviously) and a USB-C cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-poster.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top Best Nintendo Switch Emulators <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Record Nintendo Switch Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers"><a href="#Wired-Connection-for-Switch-Pro-Controllers" class="headerlink" title="Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers"></a><strong>Wired Connection for Switch Pro Controllers</strong></h2><p>Windows describe it as a DirectInput controller instead of an XInput controller, so getting it to work with PC games can prove tedious. However, thanks to Value-adding full Switch controller support to Steam, you will probably be able to play most of your favorite games.</p><p><strong>Step1:</strong> Connect the Pro Controller cable (or any USB-A-to-USB-C cable) to your PC. If your computer has a USB-C port, connect the USB-C-to-USB-C data cable instead.</p><p><strong>Step2:</strong> Connect the other end of the cable to your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable.jpg"                      alt="switch-pro-controller-connected-with-cable"                ></p><p>There you have it!

The Ken Burns effect involves slow-paced zoom and pan over a still image to evoke a sense of movement, so the audience believes that they are watching a video and not just a slide show of still photos. There are many editing tools that can help you add the Ken Burns effect to your video and Camtasia 9 is one of them.</p><p>One of the most positive impacts generated by the Camtasia Ken Burns effect is that it enables your still photos to be used in a video as though they were a part of it. The effect is not only easy to understand but also quite user-friendly to apply. That is why it is often used by beginners and amateur YouTubers and content creators to add flair to their videos. Let’s see how you can use the Camtasia Ken Burns effect.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Ken-Burns-Effect-in-Camtasia-9-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Ken-Burns-Effect-in-Camtasia-9-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Ken Burns Effect in Camtasia 9?"></a>How to Make a Ken Burns Effect in Camtasia 9?</h2><p>You have to bear in mind that Camtasia 9 isn’t the easiest editing software to use, and you will have to go through multiple steps to add the Ken Burns effect.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Open-a-New-Project-Import-Images"><a href="#Step-1-Open-a-New-Project-Import-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Open a New Project &amp; Import Images"></a>Step 1. Open a New Project &amp; Import Images</h4><p>The first step you need to take to add the Ken Burns effect to your video is to open a new project in Camtasia 9. The next thing you have to do is import the images you want to use and add them to the Media Bin. This will enable you to work on the images and add the Ken Burns effect.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Adding-Camtasia-Ken-Burns-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Adding Camtasia Ken Burns Effect"></a>Step 2. Adding Camtasia Ken Burns Effect</h4><p>Now you need to right-click on the photo present on track 1 and select the duration. Set the duration to 30 seconds. Once you have done that, you need to position the play head at the end of the video. On the left side of the screen, there is a menu that allows you to choose animations. Ensure that your <strong>Zoom and Pan</strong> tab is visible and active.</p><p>The square you see in the Zoom-n-Pan tab should be dragged to the right, so it appears to be panning through the image while the photo moves toward the left. Here you will see a small arrow on track 1 on your timeline.</p><p>At this point, all you need to do is drag that particular arrow to the left, so it spreads across the length of your video. Play the preview by pressing the space bar, and you will see the Ken Burns effect in motion.</p><p>In Camtasia 9, you have the option to experiment with zooming and panning or both to create new styles of the Ken Burns effect.

Users may meet face to face, communicate with associates via in-meeting chatting or conference call, &amp; share their presentations via screen sharing.</p><p>Meetings may be accessed via a PC, Mac, iOS, or Android device. All GoToMeeting sessions (also known as webinars) can be recorded. This article explains how to record a <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> session in detail, including a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Use the Best GoToMeeting Recorder on PC</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record GoToMeeting with an Online Recorder</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Record GoToMeeting on iPhone and Android</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-in-GoToMeeting-with-Built-in-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Record in GoToMeeting with Built-in Recorder</h2><p>Meetings can be recorded using the built-in <strong>gotomeeting recording</strong> option, but there are limits.</p><p>However, recording options must be set up before the commencement of the session. You can only record meetings using GoToMeeting’s meeting recorder if you have a premium account and admin authorization, making it a much less convenient option to record meetings.</p><p>Step 1. Just click over the “REC” icon at the top of the GoToMeeting screen once you have joined a meeting to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-start-record.jpg"                      alt="gotomeeting start record"                ></p><p>Step 2. While recording, click “Start Your Recording,” and the “REC” icon will become red. The recording of the meeting will be announced to all participants.</p><p>Step 3. Click over the “REC” icon and choose “Stop Your Recording” to stop the recording. If you’re making a local recording, the Recording Manager will open up and ask you to convert the video. However, if you’re doing a cloud recording, you’ll be sent to your online account to retrieve the footage. It takes some time for new recordings to appear in the cloud recording history.</p><p>Step 4. However, what if other participants, such as not account owners or organizers, wish to record live sessions? In this instance, you’ll need a video-recording program that works on both PCs and Macs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC"><a href="#Part-2-Use-the-Best-GoToMeeting-Recorder-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unleashing-True-Potential-in-Speech-Interpretation-Through-Google"><a href="#Unleashing-True-Potential-in-Speech-Interpretation-Through-Google" class="headerlink" title="Unleashing True Potential in Speech Interpretation Through Google"></a>Unleashing True Potential in Speech Interpretation Through Google</h2><p>Speech to text service is becoming mainstream with each passing day. In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate. In addition, you can switch between playback speeds by pressing the Listen button repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part2-How-to-translate-recorded-speeches-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?"></a>Part2: How to translate recorded speeches with Google Translate?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Google Translate does not support the translation of audio file uploads, such as recorded speeches and music files. The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate? Follow the below steps:</p><h3 id="Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio"><a href="#Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio" class="headerlink" title="Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio"></a>Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio</h3><p>As earlier mentioned, you can only use Google Translate with text documents and websites. As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above. You will then follow the below steps to finish translating your speech recording.</p><ol><li>Launch Google Translate on your device.</li><li>Tap the Documents tab from the app’s home screen.</li><li>Select the Detect Language option for the left box, and choose your desired translation language for the right box. Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work. This is because the app can sometimes ignore the translation language’s grammar and punctuation rules.</li></ol><h3 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?</h3><p>Google translate voice to text is among the top voice typing apps in the market.
