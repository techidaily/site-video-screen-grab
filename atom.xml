The new iPhone 7 comes with an array of new next-gen technology that is sure to leave you breathless. There is no headphone jack, the phone feature new and improved display, the iPhone 7 plus has rear dual cameras that Apple says is a game changer. The phone is waterproof, and it also comes with a new chic design with a variety of colors to choose from such as ‘Jet Black’.</p><p> Bloggers and Vloggers have a reason to smile with the release of the new iPhone 7. Making tutorials is now easier with the new iPhone. There are several ways to go about. You can either use Quicktime on Mac, Reflector on PC or a third party app called AirShou. All of these methods are great, but you want to find the technique that best fits your purposes.</p><h2 id="How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus"><a href="#How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus"></a>How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> Now with iOS 11, you can just record the screen with its built-in tool, check this video to know how-to steps:</p><h4 id="Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac"></a>Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac</h4><p> On the new iPhone 7, recording your screen with Quicktime will require you to have two things.</p><ul><li>a) Mac with OS X (Yosemite) or later</li><li>b) Lightning Port and iOS 8 or later</li></ul><p> <strong>How to Record iPhone 7 Screen Using Quicktime on Mac</strong></p><ul><li>1. First, you need to connect the iPhone 7 to your Mac using the lightning cable.</li><li>2. Once the connection is detected, start the Quicktime software on your Mac.</li><li>3. Look for the File option and select ‘Record a Movie.’</li><li>4. Look for the record button and select the dropdown arrow to show more options.</li><li>5. There, you will find the option to record the screen of your iPhone 7. Immediately you select this option, you will notice that your iPhone’s screen is duplicated on your Mac.</li><li>6. If you only want to record the screen without any voice over sound, then click the ‘None’ option as your microphone. If you want to track your on-screen clicks, then select the ‘Show Mouse Clicks’ option.</li><li>7. Use the volume slider to monitor the recording’s audio.</li><li>8. If you want to record a certain portion of your screen, simply drag the area you want to record and then tap the recording button within that area to start recording, otherwise, if it’s the whole screen, simply tap anywhere on the screen to start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Method 2 Using Reflector on PC"></a>Method 2 Using Reflector on PC</h4><p> Using Reflector is probably the easiest and most convenient way to record your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus screen. Since it’s a third-party app, you will need to first download it to your computer, then simply install it on you Mac, Windows PC or Chrome Book. For Reflector to work on your iPhone, you need to have installed Airplay on your device. Reflector works the same way Quicktime does, by mirroring your iPhone 7 screen on the computer’s screen.</p><p> Launch Reflector on your computer then launch Airplay on your device and then ensure that ‘Mirroring’ option is turned on. Once your iPhone detects your computer, connect to it and then simply record your IPhone screen with your computer.</p><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> The beauty about this method is that one, it caters for everyone, unlike using Quicktime which is only for Mac users and two, it does not need any cables or adapters since it is wireless.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App"><a href="#Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 3 Using the AirShou App"></a>Method 3 Using the AirShou App</h4><ul><li>a) Download AirShou directly on your iPhone 7. Users with iOS 9.3 or higher are required to set back their dates to 2012 for the apps to install without issues.</li><li>b) You will get a popup telling you that the app isn’t trusted, but go ahead to your settings and allow this program to be installed.</li><li>c) Before you start recording, make sure ‘mirroring’ in airplay is on and your device is selected.</li><li>d) Simply launch the AirShou app and then create a free account and then start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> This app requires no jailbreaking and will work on iOS 7 and 8 as well as iOS 9 or higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698"                      border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos"><a href="#How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos" class="headerlink" title="How to edit your recorded videos"></a>How to edit your recorded videos</h2><p> Video Editing with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> WondershareFilmora has been proven effective in editing recorded videos in iPhone 7 and previous versions.</p><ul><li>a) It supports a bunch of video formats such as .mp4, .avi, .mov, .avchd and lots more.</li><li>b) It enables you to trim, crop, combine, and split and cut your video(s).</li><li>c) It has an amazing filter gallery and awesome effects.</li><li>d) You can save the edited video in any format you choose, and enough to fit in your phone.</li><li>e) Edited videos are burnable on DVD, and can be uploaded on the internet.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now you have an idea of how to record your iPhone 7 screen with all these amazing methods.

If you would like to find out how to record your screen on an Android phone or tablet, there are various options on offer such as using an app, connecting to computer via official ADB method and also custom ROMs together with built in facility.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website. Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly.

It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

Key Features of Active Presenter</h2><p>Active Presenter is a popular tutorial and software simulation screen recorder that is known for its key features. It offers many of the same capabilities as a standard screen recorder, allowing users to record any type of video.</p><p>Recording – Recording allows you to capture video from your screen and webcam at the same time or independently, and audio from your system or an external microphone.

Complex modifications can also be made to audio and video clips - users can insert clips, speed up or slow down videos, blur items or apply green screen effects to them.</p><p>Software Simulation – Apart from recording regular video, you can record software simulation. In software simulation, you get a series of slides instead of a video. These slides can be regular slides or video slides. In video slides, your scrolling actions and drag-and-drop actions are recorded with full-motion recording.

The design is responsive and hence, it can run on any web browser on any device.</p><p>Versatile Export Options – Various export options are available, allowing you to export your video in multiple file formats including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MKV. You can also customize the frame rate, video quality, keyframe parameters, and other settings to decrease the output file size.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Use-Active-Presenter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Top keyboard makers are constantly pushing the boundaries of speed, design, material, and functionality. High pricing is inevitable as a result of this competitiveness. But don’t be concerned! So you don’t have to break the bank, we’ve compiled a list of the best gaming keyboard under 100$. This article is ideal for individuals on a budget who are searching for high-quality mechanical boards.</p><p>We evaluated many choices, starting at $36, and tested the many types of keyboard that delivered excellent value for money — somewhat unexpectedly, the cheapest option was the one we wouldn’t suggest. A new gaming keyboard may make a significant impact if you are starting to work from home or just playing more PC games than you did a few months ago.</p><p>Getting the proper gaming keyboard, like getting the proper gaming mouse, comes down to personal preference — from comfortability (wrist rest) about whether you would like RGB Lights, mechanical buttons, tactile feedback, configurable keys, separate media keys, or a slew of other features we can’t begin to list. Also, check out our dictionary of keyboard terminology to help you narrow down your design choices.</p><h3 id="1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO"><a href="#1-Corsair-RGB-K55-XT-PRO" class="headerlink" title="1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO"></a>1.Corsair RGB K55 XT PRO</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro.jpg"                      alt="corsair-rgb-k55-xt-pro"                ></p><p>The Corsair K55 RGB PRO XT is the best gaming keyboard for under 100$ with non-mechanical buttons. It features rubber dome buttons, unlike most of the other keyboards on this list. They’re a little heavier to push than traditional mechanical keyboards, and they don’t provide the same haptic feedback, and they’re still light enough to satisfy gamers.</p><p>It’s jam-packed with gaming features, including the ability to assign macros to any key and six additional macro keys just on the left side. It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest. Thus it shouldn’t be too tiring to use for extended gaming sessions.</p><h5 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Its keys are very quiet</p><p>finest gaming keyboard with non-mechanical keys</p><h5 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>Its typing quality is low</p><p>The ABS keycaps are slick and unstable, which leads to inadvertent key presses</p><h3 id="2-EVGA-Z12"><a href="#2-EVGA-Z12" class="headerlink" title="2.EVGA Z12"></a>2.EVGA Z12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/evga-z12.png"                      alt="evga-z12"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296855&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/recode/Nero_Recode_Screen_2.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Look at the EVGA Z12 if you want something even cheaper. The unique EVGA Waterproof rubber dome buttons are lighter to push than Corsair RBG K55 PRO XT. Therefore gaming isn’t as responsive. They have a smaller pre-travel distance, which means they type more accurately. This is a good option if you are searching for the best gaming keyboard under 100$.</p><h5 id="Pros-1"><a href="#Pros-1" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Five macro keys and each one is reprogrammed.</p><p>Separate media buttons.</p><p>Full-size keyboard.</p><h5 id="Cons-1"><a href="#Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>It is zone-lit rather than RGB.</p><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory.</p><p>Gaming isn’t as responsive.</p><h3 id="3-G413-Logitech"><a href="#3-G413-Logitech" class="headerlink" title="3.G413 Logitech"></a>3.G413 Logitech</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/g413-logitech.png"                      alt="g413-logitech"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>A good keyboard with excellent gaming performance should appeal to the majority of entry-level gamers. We can say Logitech’s G413 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$. Despite its low price, it is well-made, with a plastic body and a strong metal top half so that you will have no problems with it.</p><p>Only patented Romer-G Tactile switches are included, which feature a short pre-travel distance and provide excellent tactile feedback without being too heavy to write on. ABS keycaps feel pleasant to touch and seem to be solid. Thus the keyboard provides excellent typing quality. It offers minimal latency for gamers. Therefore you won’t even notice any lag when playing. It features individually illuminated keys and illumination. However, it’s only offered in red.</p><h5 id="Pros-2"><a href="#Pros-2" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h5><p>Macros can be assigned to any of the function keys.</p><p>You can store your settings using the G HUB Logitech online sync feature if you wish to use them on a different computer.</p><p>The best inexpensive keyboard you can buy.</p><h5 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h5><p>The keyboard also lacks onboard memory</p><h3 id="4-Z15-EVGA"><a href="#4-Z15-EVGA" class="headerlink" title="4.Z15 EVGA"></a>4.Z15 EVGA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/z15-evga.png"                      alt="z15-evga"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38729081&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://website-prod.cache.wpscdn.com/img/wps-office-pdf-editor-1x.890dbda.png"                      border="0"                ><br>WPS Office Premium ( File Recovery, Photo Scanning, Convert PDF)–Yearly</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The EVGA Z15 is the best gaming keyboard under 100$ with mechanical keys that we’ve tested. It’s an excellent gaming keyboard featuring a few extra functions to enhance your gaming experience. It’s full-size, with a sturdy frame and superior quality finishing, but still, ABS keycaps aren’t as comfortable as PBT.</p><p>It comes with vertical Kailh Speed Silver and Kailh clicky Speed Bronze keys, both of which we tried, and it’s hot-swappable so that you can use anything you like.

It features complete RGB illumination and individually illuminated keys, which you can configure using the iCUE software, available for Windows and macOS. The latency is also quite minimal, which is fantastic. The keyboard includes one inclination setting and wrist rest.

Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.dbschema.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19867419&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/176b22bab4e94a28619ca2433b2ef241/products/1_icon256.png"                      border="0"                ><br>DbSchema database designer for all databases, schema design in the team, schema deployment, interactive diagrams, documentation, data and query tools. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4665597&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.pcclean.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/winutilities-box-130521.png"                      border="0"                >WinUtilities Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://printrendy.pxf.io/c/5597632/1453720/17020" target="_top" id="1453720"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17020-1453720"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1453720/17020"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Practices-for-OBS-Based-Skype-Recording"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-OBS-Based-Skype-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for OBS-Based Skype Recording"></a>Best Practices for OBS-Based Skype Recording</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking. Then press ‘lock’ using the NDI plug-in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-program-set-up-for-skype.jpg"                      alt="obs program set up for skype"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-vlc-videos-source.jpg"                      alt="obs vlc videos source"                ></p><p>To setup NDI plugin you have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1" >https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check for the compatible version with your operating system. On this website the plugin is available for windows, mac and Linux.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obc-ndi-plugin-visit.jpg"                      alt="obc ndi plugin visit"                ></p><p>And after addition of plug in you would want to click on ‘+’ again and select NDI plugin and you can select the source video which is going to be the received video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-additon-of-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="obs additon of plug in"                ></p><p>And clicking on it will open a new window where you have to select the guest feed, which will be possible once the call has begun. The call connected will appear on the NDI plugin window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-new-window-select-the-guest-feed.jpg"                      alt="obs new window select the guest feed"                ></p><p>As you receive the call from the reciever you will see the incoming feed of him as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-receive-the-call.jpg"                      alt="obs receive the call"                ></p><p>So you can just resize it similarly as you did yours earlier and pressing the lock icon will stop you from mistakenly modify or change the video screen settings. Now to record the video you have to click on record button and your desktop starts recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-resize-it-similarly.jpg"                      alt="obs resize it similarly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype"><a href="#Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype"></a>Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype</h2><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a very popular and perfect <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor designed by Wondershare.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that. Let’s say you cough during an interview or something. You’re actually able to cut that out and you can actually record a separate feed itself.</p><p><strong>Capturing Audio in OBS Studio on a Mac</strong></p><p>On a Mac, you’ll need to install an additional OBS plugin to capture audio.</p><ul><li>Install iShowU Audio Capture on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you navigate to Security &amp; Privacy in your System Preferences.</li><li>To proceed, you may need to grant permission to “Shiny White Box.”</li><li>Restart your Mac after the installation is complete.</li><li>Open Audio MIDI Setup after rebooting.</li><li>At the bottom left of the window, click the Plus button.</li><li>Select Create Multi-Output Device from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p>So form the above discussion it can be concluded that OBS for screen recording can be a very handy tool because it has the ability to easily record skype videos along with separate audio recording to avoid interference of sounds and mix ups. The separate audio recording system allows us to manipulate and modify the sounds along with the video quality. Skype is a tool much used by the world for quite some time and it still continues to serve us with numerous improvements and updates to simplify the complex world of networking today and the tools to use it properly help us communicate better with others. Also you can add cool graphics with your video to ornate your work. So If you want to buy graphics, templates, and other similar items, even if you only have rudimentary Photoshop skills, there are a lot of really skilled designers on here with pretty affordable costs if you want to buy graphics and other similar items.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-10-leading-free-online-recording-tools-expert-opinions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  10 Leading Free Online Recording Tools -
