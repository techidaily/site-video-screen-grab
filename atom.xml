Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center.

When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone.

Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island-3"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island-3" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

After you sign in to your Zoom account, you should click on your profile picture and click on Settings in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-general-settings.jpg"                      alt="  Zoom General Setting Options"                ></p><p>Go to the General tab and click on the checkbox next to the Use Dual Monitors option. In addition, you must disable the Remote Support setting before you start a meeting. Once the meeting starts you should click on the arrow next to the Screen Share icon and pick the Multiple participants can share simultaneously option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-multiple-screens-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Share Multiple Screens on  Zoom "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144283/7443" target="_top" id="2144283">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144283" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144283/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once this option is activated all participants will be able to share their screens, although the participants who are using the mobile app to participate in a meeting can only share screens if no one else is sharing their screen.</p><p>The participants in the meeting who are using a dual monitor setup will be able to see two most recently shared screens, while the participants who only have one monitor can only see one screen at the time. Clicking on the View Options will enable you to select the screen you are currently viewing.</p><p>Changing the screen you’re viewing from the Zoom mobile app is not possible. Furthermore, the Share Computer Audio and Optimize for full-screen video clips are unavailable when multiple screens are shared at the same time.</p><h2 id="What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working"><a href="#What-to-Do-If-the-Share-Screen-Option-isn’t-Working" class="headerlink" title="What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?"></a>What to Do If the Share Screen Option isn’t Working?</h2><p>Before you install Zoom on your computer or your Smartphone you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of the OS your device is using. So, if you can’t find the Screen Share button, you should check if the application is compatible with the operating system.</p><p>Furthermore, Windows users who see only a black screen after they share their screen should switch back to the computer’s integrated graphics. You can do this by going to the Windows Control Panel and selecting the graphic card’s control panel.</p><p>Click on the Manage 3D Settings option and then choose I would like to use the following 3D settings from the Program Settings menu. You should then go to the Select a Program to Customize the menu and add the Cphost.exe file from the Zoom Bin directory.</p><p>Proceed to click on the Add Selected Program, choose the Integrated Graphics setting and click on the Apply button. Head back to Zoom and check if the black screen issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sharing one or more screens during meetings on Zoom is easy, and it won’t take much more than a few moments of your time, regardless of the device you’re using to run this application. However, you should keep in mind that mobile and web-based versions of the app offer only limited capabilities and that only Mac and PC versions of the app enable users to share multiple screens simultaneously.

It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. <strong>Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors</strong>. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.</p><p><strong>The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound</strong>. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?</h2><p>As mentioned in the specifications section, there’s an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. <strong>But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well</strong>.</p><p>There’s a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is <strong>great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube</strong>.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello</strong>. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.</p><p>Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities"><a href="#Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?"></a>Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?</h2><p><strong>Right now, there aren’t many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.</strong> The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. <strong>You’ll also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to truly appreciate the picture</strong> and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record 4K videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, such as Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there</strong>. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.</p><p>Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you’re a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134238/18498" target="_top" id="2134238">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134238" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134238/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075472/7443" target="_top" id="2075472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075472/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Logitech’s 4K Pro camera shows just how far webcams have come.

It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design-2"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>.

Because what the 4K Pro offers is a glimpse into the 4K future!</p><p>In this article we will provide a comprehensive review of this Logitech 4K webcam, breaking it down to the essentials, so you can decide if this is the gadget for your YouTube streaming or video recordings.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Hardware Specification Glimpse</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Logitech 4K Webcam Design Review</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Picture and Sound Quality Test</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Logitech 4K Webcam main features</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Logitech 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities Test</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg"                      alt=" Logitech 4K Webcam "                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification-3"><a href="#Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification"></a>Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification</h2><p>The Logitech 4K Pro features <strong>4K Ultra HD streaming up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 30 FPS</strong>. It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design-3"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. <strong>Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors</strong>. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.</p><p><strong>The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound</strong>. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?</h2><p>As mentioned in the specifications section, there’s an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. <strong>But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well</strong>.</p><p>There’s a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is <strong>great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube</strong>.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello</strong>. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.</p><p>Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?"></a>Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?</h2><p><strong>Right now, there aren’t many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.</strong> The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. <strong>You’ll also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to truly appreciate the picture</strong> and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record 4K videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, such as Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there</strong>. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.</p><p>Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you’re a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The application is specifically designed to match the high performance of MacBooks with the macOS support. The interface inside the application is handy with a bunch of tools for utilizing every aspect of sound recording. With Sound Studio you will feel almost like sitting in a record room with professional hardware.</p><p>The app even lets you digitalize any of the records from tapes as well as vinyl records and also lets you record any live performances that are going on with high-quality audio output. The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Here’s more about it:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio"></a>Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:</p><p><strong>1. High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn’t be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.</p><p><strong>3. Fast and convenient editing</strong></p><p>The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.</p><p><strong>4. Digital conversion</strong></p><p>The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6.
