The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere4"                ></p><hr><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Creating such amazing things and sharing them on your social media and video sharing platforms can get you a lot of audience and views.

Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each.

The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere.

As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.</p><p>These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-3"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image.

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you. The adaptability of OBS Studio answers your demands and enables you to link Zoom with OBS Studio.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Use Roblox Built-In Game Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu. Find and click on the plugin you have downloaded and follow the vizard to replicate OBS output as a virtual camera.</p><p>**<strong>Configure Zoom:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> In Zoom, begin a meeting, then pick a video source. The new option introduced by your OBS plugin will display. Select it and then click on the Start Video option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-zoom.jpg"                      alt="configure zoom"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> The Zoom’s video will now accept the input from the virtual camera, which is the output provided by OBS Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/accept-the-input.jpg"                      alt="accept the input"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Most of you will be on a mobile device and mobile device displays are of a different aspect ratio than your PC. Click on the Profile menu on OBS at the top and click on New Profile and name the Profile as per your convenience.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Live-Stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.</p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg"                      alt="click on the add"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam. You may select “Start Streaming” if you need to webcast the conference elsewhere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-streaming.jpg"                      alt="start streaming"                ></p><p>If you wish to put yourself into the Stream from your PC associated webcam or other video devices linked, utilize the Video Source Option instead of Window Capture and specify your target device when adding the source. Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic&#x2F;Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Part 3. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this. Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Zoom and OBS. In OBS, under “Sources,” click the Plus button and choose “Display Capture.” This will work best if you have more than one monitor for your PC, but it will still operate if you just have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-zomm-meetings.jpg"                      alt="record zoom meetings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You may use the “Window Capture” option and pick “Zoom.exe” as your source, although this might not always work. Name the capture anything you wish, then click “OK.” You may use the name of the monitor you’re using for Zoom to keep things simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg"                      alt="window capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> In OBS, click on “+” under “Sources” again, then pick “Audio Input Capture.” Rename the capture source if you wish to keep it distinct from the other source and prevent misunderstanding, then hit “OK.” Press “Start Recording.” Maximize Zoom to full-screen mode to make it the only visible application on display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-input-capture.jpg"                      alt="audio input capture"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>OBS enables recording into several video formats. But the major reason why you may want to learn how to record Zoom meetings using OBS is that the software may help firms gain a step ahead on their video production. OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this. Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS-3"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-Zoom-Meetings-with-OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS"></a>Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Zoom and OBS. In OBS, under “Sources,” click the Plus button and choose “Display Capture.” This will work best if you have more than one monitor for your PC, but it will still operate if you just have one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-zomm-meetings.jpg"                      alt="record zoom meetings"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> You may use the “Window Capture” option and pick “Zoom.exe” as your source, although this might not always work. Name the capture anything you wish, then click “OK.” You may use the name of the monitor you’re using for Zoom to keep things simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg"                      alt="window capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> In OBS, click on “+” under “Sources” again, then pick “Audio Input Capture.” Rename the capture source if you wish to keep it distinct from the other source and prevent misunderstanding, then hit “OK.” Press “Start Recording.” Maximize Zoom to full-screen mode to make it the only visible application on display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-input-capture.jpg"                      alt="audio input capture"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>OBS enables recording into several video formats. But the major reason why you may want to learn how to record Zoom meetings using OBS is that the software may help firms gain a step ahead on their video production. OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"

Best Alternative"></a>4. Best Alternative</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with MyCam screen recorder due to limited features and editing options, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to MyCam.

Here are the steps to record webcam and screen with Filmora.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora. It is available for Windows and Mac users. Launch Filmora after installation and click on PC Screen option to record webcam along with the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-01.png"                      alt="pc screen"                ></p><p>Step 2: Choose the recording screen area and select the audio sources as per your requirements. Record webcam and screen video together by enabling Record the Camera Stream option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-04.png"                      alt="recording panel"                ></p><p>Step 3: When you are ready to record, click on Record button. Press F9 key to stop recording. Take your time to edit the recording and export instantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-the-project.jpg"                      alt="export the project"                ></p><p>If you want to record your webcam video, MyCam serves the purpose perfectly. But it can record only webcam videos and hence, this makes the application less versatile for different purposes. You cannot record from multiple video sources such as you cannot record screen and webcam together. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to MyCam.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora.

Using OBS game capture, you may record screen games for YouTube videos or share snippets of gameplay with your friends for free. With this article, we’ll cover how to record in OBS and how much storage space you’ll need for your recordings. With OBS, it’s easy to keep track of high scores, great in-game performances, and even tips on how to play like a pro quickly and effectively. Since gamers may use several third-party screen-recording techniques when recording their games, learning how to record gameplay using OBS is an ideal solution. An open-source tool called OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) will be utilized in this lesson.</p><p>It is widely utilized by both large and small broadcasters throughout the world because of its reliability as a streaming solution. Despite this, it’s an effective tool for capturing images. OBS Studio enables you to record video directly to your device instead of broadcasting your screen. The days of framed screenshots and complex settings are over. Video game streamers and teachers with a lot of video presentations are likely to be acquainted with the OBS Studio. However, due to the complex user interface, it’s a little tough for beginners to utilize. The good news is that there are a variety of OBS options to pick from. When it comes to performance, it’s on par with other, more costly options. For the most part, the program allows for live streaming to several sites, such as Facebook Live and Hitbox.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install OBS on Mac"></a>1. Download and Install OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS is an open-source screen recorder and live streamer that is free to use. It’s now available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. It’s a popular choice among more seasoned customers because of the large variety of options available in the product.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to the OBS Website</strong></p><p>Go to the OBS download page using your choice browser and save the installation file to your computer’s hard drive.<br>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://obsproject.com/download" >OBS Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Step 2: Get the Most Recent Version of the Software</strong></p><p>You may get the most recent version of OBS for Mac by clicking the button on the OBS website.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Download and Install the Software for Mac</strong></p><p>Open the package after downloading it. Drag the OBS icon to the Applications folder when the installer has been opened.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-and-install.jpg"                      alt="download video from funimate"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Get Started!</strong></p><p>Open OBS for the first time by going to the Applications folder and double-clicking on it. Selected ‘Continue’ will bring up a Welcome Screen for the Installer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-started.jpg"                      alt="get-started"                ></p><h2 id="2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac"><a href="#2-Best-OBS-Settings-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="2. Best OBS Settings for Mac"></a>2. Best OBS Settings for Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is a complex software that comes with pre-installed screencasting capabilities. Free software often lacks the breadth of features required for flawless broadcasting, but not with OSB Studio. Even though the program is free, it features all of the crucial components that characterize online broadcasting. Many additional parts and modules will be given by the software now and then. That suggests it’s really necessary to dabble and refresh with it. Else, you can experience a few hassles in using OBS correctly.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch and Create Output Recorder Setup</strong></p><p>Add on the Plus symbol and create the project. If you want to activate audio monitoring in OBS Studio: Right-click in the Output box, Open the Output mode or you can also go for Advanced Audio Properties:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-recorder-setup.jpg"                      alt="output recorder setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Customize Record Only Feature</strong></p><p>In OBS for Mac, this setting will deliver the sound of the source to the Desktop as it were. Work area sound should be enabled for the sound to be captured. As soon as you activate this option, navigate towards the recording interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record.jpg"                      alt="customize record"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Set the Screen and Output Mode</strong></p><p>In OBS Studio for Mac, this setting will broadcast the sound of the source to the stream and Desktop sound separately. This takes into mind individual sound control. To do so, go to the bottom right corner of your screen and pick “settings.” Then, under “recording path,” select the “output” option to specify the spot on your computer where you desire to keep the recordings. Right after that, press the Record button to start recording your Game Audio in parallel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-mode.jpg"                      alt="output mode"                ></p><h2 id="3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#3-How-to-Record-Screen-with-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac"></a>3. How to Record Screen with OBS on Mac</h2><p>OBS Studio is open-source, free software that is worth a try for all users. This strategy may be used to solve the problem if you have two graphics cards, one of which is NVIDIA. The OBS black screen is most likely caused by OBS and the game you desire to record running on different graphics cards in this situation. The image of the game can’t be acquired as they’re on separate adapters, and it’s not available on the device OBS is utilizing.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install and Launch OBS</strong></p><p>To purchase OBS Studio, go to the OBS Project’s official website and join up for their download portal. OBS is available for download and installation. After that, determine whether you want to use Windows, macOS, or Linux. Click the “Windows” download option on the left to acquire OBS for Windows. After clicking it, the download for OBS Studio will begin and the user will be able to locate it on their computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-and-launch.jpg"                      alt="install and launch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Scenes for Recording</strong></p><p>OBS Studio will be available on their PC when the installation is complete, and players may use it to record their Valorous games. The software, on the other hand, does not come pre-configured for recording and must be set up manually. Scenes should be added. Open OBS and go to the bottom left of the screen to the “+” icon below “scenes.” Add a “recording” scenario to the mix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-scenes.jpg"                      alt="add scenes"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Customize the Recording</strong></p><p>Users should go to the Output tab and set the Video Bitrate to 6000 Kbps, Encoder to Hardware, and Audio Bitrate to 256 after entering the settings. Users may also adjust the location of their recording by choosing the save path location in the same settings tab., in the “recording” scene, click the “+” sign below “sources” on the bottom left of the screen, and add a “display capture.” If you have more than one monitor, specify which one you wish to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-tab.jpg"                      alt="output tab"                ></p><p>You may add a “Video Capture Device” to capture your webcam and an “Audio Input Capture” to gather the sounds from your microphone if you wish to. The next step is for users to go to the Audio tab and deactivate Desktop Audio. Users may add an audio input device, such as a microphone, by setting the Mic&#x2F;Auxiliary device under the same tab.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Setup the Recording</strong></p><p>Now, in the bottom left corner of the screen, click the “Scene” button, and then tap the Add icon next to the scene tab under the sources tab. A drop-down menu will display after selecting the add button, enabling you to add Game Capture and Audio Output Capture. Two more tabs will appear under the sources tab, which must be set. Choose a shooting location as well as a video type. Finally, pick “recording format” and “mp4” (or any other file type) from the drop-down menu. In the “Best Parameters for OBS Recordings,” we’ll go over various additional variables that need to be modified to ensure high-quality outputs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p><p>Users may start recording their gameplay by hitting the “Start Recording” button on the bottom-right of OBS Studio when everything is set up. To stop recording, simply press the Stop Recording button, and the video will be saved at the previously set location. Now is the moment to hit the “start recording” button.</p><h2 id="4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac"><a href="#4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Concept-to-Capture-The-Breakdown-of-Apeak’s-Recorder-Software"><a href="#From-Concept-to-Capture-The-Breakdown-of-Apeak’s-Recorder-Software" class="headerlink" title="From Concept to Capture: The Breakdown of Apeak’s Recorder Software"></a>From Concept to Capture: The Breakdown of Apeak’s Recorder Software</h2><p>Apeaksoft Screen Recorder is a free program that enables you to quickly record video and sound from your computer’s screen. You may easily record online video and sound, games, meetings, video instructive exercises, and so on in the highest possible quality. You may establish the chronicle region, create recording settings, examine and save the recorded documents as genuine arrangements using this easy to use video and sound screen recorder. You won’t need to buy another downloader if you use this screen recording program since it will save you time and transfer speed by recording instead of downloading.</p><p>If you need to record a video conference, you should use this Apeaksoft screen recorder review to activate both of them. Streaming games have grown more popular in recent years, necessitating the creation of video training activities for using various types of software. None of this would be possible without the right tools for the job, which is mostly where an application like Apeaksoft screen recorder free comes in. Its Apeaksoft screen recorder Mac version is more spectacular than downloader since it can preserve more, such as gaming measurements, video gatherings, and web-based recordings, among other things. These features are the highlight of this Apeaksoft screen recorder review. When you record a video, you have the option of recording the real video’s speech using the framework sound or recording your own voice using amplifier voice.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Download-and-Use-Apeaksoft-Recorder"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Download-and-Use-Apeaksoft-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Download and Use Apeaksoft Recorder"></a>Part 1. How to Download and Use Apeaksoft Recorder</h2><p>You may also capture the lock window using Screen Recorder. You may also pick which screen you wish to capture if you have multiple screen devices. To provide customers with the highest level of efficiency, it can capture recordings&#x2F;sounds of any duration as needed and on occasion by arranging scheduled tasks. As amazing as the Screen Recorder is, it allows you to create the settings you want ahead of time and then record video using those settings at a later date. If you have a lot of on-screen workouts to record in a comparable interest, it’s a big plus.</p><p>Step 1. Keeping Track of Screen Movements</p><p>You may use this screen recording program on your PC once you’ve installed it. From the main interface, choose “Video Recorder.” You should choose the accounting zone before recording continuous contact, Skype calls, online meetings, or real-time recordings with this screen capturing program.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-movement.jpg"                      alt="screen movement"                ></p><p>Step 2. Change the Sound Settings</p><p>If you’re going to record a video gathering or a Skype call, you’ll probably need to pick both the foundation sound and the amplifier. To verify that the checkmarks appear, snap the framework sound and mouthpiece together.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-the-sound-settings.jpg"                      alt="change the sound settings"                ></p><p>Step 3. Record PC Screen</p><p>To begin recording, click “REC” on the right side of this video screen recorder once you’ve adjusted the chronicle zone and sound. Furthermore, it will display the hotkeys. You may change it to suit your needs. By pressing the composing sign throughout the chronicle, you may construct a sketch or add explanations according on your needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-pc-screen.jpg"                      alt="record pc screen"                ></p><p>Step 4. Save the Recorded Video</p><p>To finish the recording procedure, snap the red square in the top left corner. It will then display you all of the papers that have been recorded since that time. It also has a variety of gadgets on the right-hand sidebar that you may use to change recordings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-the-recording-video.jpg"                      alt="save the recording video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Key-Features-of-Apeaksoft-Recorder"><a href="#Part-2-Key-Features-of-Apeaksoft-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Key Features of Apeaksoft Recorder"></a>Part 2. Key Features of Apeaksoft Recorder</h2><p>**<strong>Screen Recorder with a Simple Interface</strong></p><p>The video recorder has the greatest number of options to provide. It allows you to record the entire screen or a specific area, as well as include framework sounds, as well as mouthpiece and webcam inputs. You can fine-tune how the product captures video film, including changing the quality and edge rate. Apeaksoft Screen Recorder also enables you to store configuration profiles so that you can quickly switch between different settings.</p><p>**<strong>Keep Track of The Game’s Progress.</strong></p><p>You may record any ongoing conversation you like and then share it with friends, or you can record videos of other people’s interactions from the internet to enhance your playing skills.</p><p>**<strong>Two-in-One Recorder:</strong></p><p>The application has distinct options for video and sound recording, as well as screen capture, so it meets a wider range of requirements than you may think.</p><p>**<strong>Create a video tutorial</strong></p><p>Any on-screen workouts will be recorded on your PC over time. With this Apeaksoft screen recorder free version, you may include your mouse pointer with redid size and shading to make your movie appear crisper.</p><p>**<strong>Separate Media Manager</strong></p><p>Apeaksoft Screen Recorder comes with its own media manager, which makes locating screen grabs and chronicles much easier than using Windows Explorer. Additionally, the software provides options for modifying and transferring records, as well as moving them to an iOS device; however, you must download and install additional toolkits for these tasks.</p><p>**<strong>Make A Video Recording of Any Videos</strong></p><p>On the PC, Apeaksoft Screen Recorder is a powerful video capture program. You won’t need to check for any other sources for extensive specifications after reading our Apeaksoft screen recorder review.</p><p>**<strong>Mouse Cursor Highlighting</strong></p><p>This is very useful for making video introductions. You may utilize the mouse cursor to make it easier to track your activities on-screen. You may also describe the tone of the feature and its current condition.</p><p>**<strong>Any Audio Source May Be Recorded</strong></p><p>This ingredient is what makes this Screen Recorder unique. When you record a video, you have the option of recording the real video’s speech using the framework sound or recording your own voice using amplifier voice. You should turn both of them on if you need to record a video conference.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Apeaksoft-Recorder-In-Depth-Review"><a href="#Part-3-Apeaksoft-Recorder-In-Depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Apeaksoft Recorder In-Depth Review"></a>Part 3. Apeaksoft Recorder In-Depth Review</h2><p>Apeaksoft Screen Recorder has its own media manager, which makes finding screenshots and recordings much more convenient than using Windows Explorer. You may also edit and convert the files, as well as transfer them to an iOS device, using the program, but you’ll need to obtain and install other tools for these tasks. The program is simple to use and has a contemporary and appealing interface. It allows you to record video and audio, as well as capture separate screen photos if desired.</p><p>**<strong>Performance:</strong></p><p>You can modify the recording area, schedule tasks, adjust audio settings, and more with Apeaksoft Screen Recorder. You might also preview the captured files before storing them. It also enables you to highlight the mouse pointer to make tracking your actions on screen simpler. You may also customize the color and form of the highlight.</p><p>Hot-keys and key bindings are nothing new to gamers, therefore utilizing them with this application will be a piece of cake. You may program your hotkeys to do anything from start, pause, or stop a recording to capturing screenshots or turning off the camera stream.

All you have to do is double-click on the Xbox button and the screenshot will be captured. A sidebar will appear on the screen asking you if you want to take a screenshot or record the last 30 seconds of the gameplay. Just hit the Y button to save the screenshot.

Taking a 4K screenshot on Xbox One requires you to adjust the capturing settings.</p><p>Press the Xbox button on the controller, and locate the System menu. Select the Settings option from the System menu and then click on the Preferences submenu. Navigate to the Broadcast&amp;Capture option and when the new menu appears on the screen, click on the Game clip resolution and select one of the available 4K settings.</p><p>Keep in mind that 4K screenshots are significantly larger in size than those in HD or any other resolution so if you would like to share a screenshot on social media you’ll first have to download it to your Windows 10 PC and resize it.

Both of them enable you to take screenshots using voice commands. If your Xbox One has the Kinect motion sensor, you should issue the ‘Xbox take a screenshot’ command. Viewing the screenshot immediately after it was taken, requires you to say ‘Xbox open that’ and the screenshot will pop up on the screen or you can just push and hold the Xbox button on the controller.</p><p>You can say ‘ Hey <em>Cortana, take a screenshot’</em> if your Xbox One features a Cortana motion sensor. However, in order to be able to issue voice commands, you must first activate this option. Head over to the Xbox One’s Settings menu and locate the All Settings option. Click on System and switch on the AI Companion feature.</p><p>It is important to say the command clearly so the AI can understand what you are trying to do, and for that reason, you should try to avoid capturing screenshots or recording videos via voice commands in noisy rooms.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One"><a href="#How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?"></a>How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?</h2><p>Capturing screenshots of the epic moments in an Xbox One video game and sharing those images with your friends is equally simple.

Repeat this action until you are able to see the content feed your friends shared with you. Locate the screenshot you’d like to share and press the Menu button on the controller. A new window will emerge on the screen and you should simply select the Share option and then proceed to choose whether you want to send the screenshot as a private message, upload it to OneDrive or post it to Twitter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-screenshot-share.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Screenshot "                ></p><h4 id="2-Manage-and-Share-Xbox-Screenshots-via-Windows-10-PC"><a href="#2-Manage-and-Share-Xbox-Screenshots-via-Windows-10-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.

The process is straightforward and it includes only a few simple steps. After you’ve installed the Xbox app on your Windows 10 PC you should open it and then you should click on the Game DVR option. Select the Xbox live feature from the DVR menu and proceed to choose the screenshots and videos you’d like to save on your PC. Click Download to complete the process.</p><p>Once the images and videos are saved on your computer, you can access them from the Xbox app. Once again head over to the DVR menu and select the On this PC option. Now you can select the screenshot you want to access and then just click on the Open Folder button. This will enable you to share your images via email or post them wherever you want on the Internet.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Gaming is one of the best forms of entertainment available to us, but it is even more fun if you can capture and share your accomplishments with your friends. Luckily, Xbox One makes this process quick and easy, since you can issue a voice command and take a screenshot even in the heat of battle.</p><p>What is your favorite method of taking screenshots on Xbox One?

But, as you most probably know, most of these documents are large in size and somewhat difficult to share. Instead of wasting time waiting for a file to upload, you can simply take a screenshot and create a file that is easy to share within seconds.</p><p>On the other hand, The Internet contains such a vast amount of information, that it is sometimes easier to just capture an entire screen than it is to share a link. Luckily, you don’t have to be a skilled photo editor who knows how to merge several screenshots of a scroll page of any kind, into a single image, because there are many easier ways to accomplish this task. Let’s have a look at different methods of capturing screenshots of a full page.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Full Page Screenshot without Hotkeys</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Zooming Out the Page for Full-Screen Webpage Screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Capturing Screenshots With Browser Extensions</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Method 4: Using Online Tools for Full Page Screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Method 5: Using Screen Capturing Software for Full Page Screenshots</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Method-1-Taking-Screenshots-of-an-Entire-Page-on-Windows-Using-The-Hotkeys"><a href="#Method-1-Taking-Screenshots-of-an-Entire-Page-on-Windows-Using-The-Hotkeys" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Taking Screenshots of an Entire Page on Windows Using The Hotkeys"></a>Method 1: Taking Screenshots of an Entire Page on Windows Using The Hotkeys</h2><p>Most frequently used web browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, offer the Print option, so all you need to do in order to capture the whole page is to head over to the web page you’d like to capture, open the browser’s File menu and then click on the <strong>Print</strong> feature. If it is easier, you can just hit the <strong>CTRL + P</strong> keyboard shortcut to launch the Print window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/print-chrome-full-page.jpg"                      alt=" Full Page Screenshot"                ></p><p>Once the printing dialogue box appears on the screen you’ll be able to preview the pages of the document, adjust the printing options and select the file format. Click on the <strong>Change</strong> icon and select the <strong>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</strong>, if you are using Google Chrome to create a new document that contains the entire page. You can also create a PDF file, but this file format may include the ads or other overlaying elements on the web page. When done, click on the Print icon to save the document to the desired location on your hard drive.</p><h2 id="Method-2-Zooming-Out-the-Page-for-Full-Screen-Webpage-Screenshots"><a href="#Method-2-Zooming-Out-the-Page-for-Full-Screen-Webpage-Screenshots" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Zooming Out the Page for Full-Screen Webpage Screenshots"></a>Method 2: Zooming Out the Page for Full-Screen Webpage Screenshots</h2><p>If you’d like to avoid producing several screenshots that you’ll later have to combine into a single image or a document, you can simply hold the <strong>CTRL and -</strong> keys on Windows or <strong>Command - on</strong> a Mac OS to zoom out the page and fit it into a screen.</p><p>To capture the resized screen, simply hold the <strong>PrintScreen</strong> button on your keyboard and the image will instantly be saved to the clipboard. Afterward, you have to paste the screenshot to a new document in any graphics editor, using the <strong>CTRL and V</strong> buttons. The <strong>Cmd + Shift + 4</strong> keyboard shortcut will enable you to take quick screenshots on a Mac computer, while the <strong>Command + 0</strong> will reset the browser to normal view.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Capturing-Screenshots-With-Browser-Extensions"><a href="#Method-3-Capturing-Screenshots-With-Browser-Extensions" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Capturing Screenshots With Browser Extensions"></a>Method 3: Capturing Screenshots With Browser Extensions</h2><p>Built-in screen capturing options on Windows and Mac offer only a limited amount of features and for that reason installing the browser extensions that enable you to capture scroll web pages may be a better option.

If you have subscribed to any free or paid webinar, you should be ready to record the webinar so that you can go through the webinar at any future instance.

If you want to record webinar free, we have lined up the best webinar recording software applications.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Record-Webinar-on-PC"><a href="#Part-1-Record-Webinar-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Record Webinar on Mac"></a>Part 2. Record Webinar on Mac</h2><p>Things get easy for you if you are a Mac user. You can record any webinar on your Mac without installing any external application. You can free record webinar with QuickTime Player that comes pre-installed on Mac. You can play the recording on QuickTime itself and hence, there is not going to be any compatibility issue. Here are the steps on how to record webinar free with QuickTime Player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg"                      alt="obs setup"                ></p><p>Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player from Applications folder.

How to Record Webinar on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How to Record Webinar on iPhone</h2><p>If you are attending any webinar from your iPhone, you can go for free record webinar without installing any third-party app. This is because iOS 11 and above comes with a built-in screen recorder through which you can record anything on your iPhone screen. You can find the screen recorder on the Control Center. If it is not available, you have to go to Settings&gt; Control Center &gt; Screen Recording and turn on the screen recorder option. Here are the steps on how to record webinar on iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open the webinar on your screen that you want to record.</p><p>Step 2: Pull down Control Centre on your iPhone. Tap on Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 3: From the pop-up message, tap on Start Recording option to start recording. Make sure you turn off the microphone.</p><p>Step 4: When you want to stop recording, tap on the Red icon at the top-left corner.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Record-Webinar-on-Android-Phones"><a href="#Part-4-Record-Webinar-on-Android-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Record Webinar on Android Phones"></a>Part 4. Record Webinar on Android Phones</h2><p>Unlike iPhone, most Android phones do not have a built-in screen recorder. That is why you have to install an external screen recorder app to record webinar for free. However, you have to be careful while choosing an external screen recorder because some of them could be spyware app. We recommend Mobizen screen recorder app which comes with all the required features and necessary security. The app does not save the recorded video on their servers but only on the user’s device. There is no signing up required as you can record your screen instantly. Here are the steps on how to record webinar for free with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Install Mobizen screen recorder app from Play Store.</p><p>Step 2: Launch the app and you will see Mobizen recording widget on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open the webinar that you want to record.

Online Webinar Recording"></a>Part 5. Online Webinar Recording</h2><p>If you do not want to go for any webinar recording software free download on your computer, you can opt for an online screen recorder. This is useful for those who record webinar on the go or those who record once in a while. There are several online free screen recorders available but not all of them are safe and sound. We prefer Apowersoft free online recorder as it is a trusted recorder and it has all the required features completely. Here are the steps on how to record webinar online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apowersoft-online-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="apowersoft free online recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open your web browser and visit apowersoft.id&#x2F;free-online-screen-recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Start Recording and download the launcher.</p><p>Step 3: Install the launcher and click on Start Recording button again.

You can always go through the entire webinar once again and revise all the points discussed. We have selected the best webinar recording software free download for you that you can use as per your device. For the best outcome, we recommend Wondershare Filmora which is a professional screen recorder with video editor.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Step 1: After you download and install Wondershare Filmora, launch it and select PC Screen option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-screen.jpg"                      alt="filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 2: From Recording window, set the recording screen size and make sure that the system audio is correctly selected.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once the webinar is about to start, click on Record button to start recording.

Setting up a recording session is simple since it only requires you to click on the record button after you’ve adjusted the settings.</p><p>However, to start using this powerful online screen recording tool, you must first download and install the web launch recorder. Furthermore, the option that lets you record Computer Audio is only available on the Pro version of this online tool, while the maximum length of a video recorded with the free version of Screencast-O-Matic cannot exceed 15 minutes. The maximum quality of a video file this online tool can produce is 720p, which can be problematic for PC users who want to produce a high-quality video.</p><hr><h2 id="Recommended-Screen-Recording-Software-for-Recording-Screen-on-Windows-Mac-Computer-for-Free"><a href="#Recommended-Screen-Recording-Software-for-Recording-Screen-on-Windows-Mac-Computer-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Screen Recording Software for Recording Screen on Windows &amp; Mac Computer for Free"></a>Recommended Screen Recording Software for Recording Screen on Windows &amp; Mac Computer for Free</h2><p>If you are looking for recording software that also allows you to edit your video footage with plentiful video editing features, we recommend you try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> based on the following powerful recording and editing features.</p><ul><li>Able to Record Desktop Screen And Webcam Simultaneously</li><li>Able to Record Computer Audio And Voice Over</li><li>Splendid Annotations (creative blur and mosaic effects included) and Cursor Effects</li><li>Basic editing features like split, cut, delete, and powerful features including speed changing, blending modes, and various video effects</li><li>Multiple export options: export to various formats or upload to social media platform directly</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Only a couple of decades ago, producing a simple video clip was a complicated process that required expensive equipment as well as a considerable amount of skill and knowledge about the art and craft of video making.

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time. Rotating video in VLC is super easy, and in this article, we will explain the steps in detail.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">How to Make the Rotation Permanent</a></p><p>Part 4. <a href="#part4">Alternative Way to Rotate Videos Permanently</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Video-Editor"><a href="#Filmora-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Video Editor"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Rotate, crop, split videos easily.</p><p>Green screen, motion tracking, key framing features</p><p>Audio ducking, slience detection</p><p>Embeded with rich video templates and resources</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows"></a>Part 1. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows</h2><p>There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly. But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac"></a>Part 2. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Mac</h2><p>The process of VLC Media Player rotate video is slightly different on Mac as compared to Windows. Here are the steps to follow to rotate video on VLC temporarily.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player. Go to File &gt; Open File option to open the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have opened the file, go to Window menu option.</p><p>Step 3: From the menu, select Video Effects option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects-mac.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects mac"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Video Effects window, check Transform option.</p><p>Step 5: From the drop-down menu, select the option as per your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-rotation-options.jpg"                      alt="vlc rotation"                ></p><p>The options available are - rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Besides, you can flip horizontally or vertically.</p><p>Step 6: Once done, just close Video Effects window and the changes will get saved automatically.</p><p>Just like Windows, this rotation will automatically apply to all the videos you open thereafter. Therefore, you have to repeat the steps and uncheck Transform option to undo the rotation effect.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-the-Rotation-Permanent" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent"></a>Part 3. How to Make the Rotation Permanent</h2><p>The previous methods of VLC player rotate video on Windows and Mac will not save the video in that rotated angle as displayed.

It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly.

Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage</h3><p>The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.</p><p>So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.</p><p>Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.</li><li>Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record computer screen and webcam</p><p>Capture system and microphone audio</p><p>Customize the target recording area</p><p>Edit videos with thousands of effects and tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#1-Direct-Way-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="1. Direct Way to Stop QuickTime Recording"></a>1. Direct Way to Stop QuickTime Recording</h2><p>Under normal circumstances, you start recording with QuickTime by clicking on Record button on the top menu bar or on the Record button on the Recording bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-quicktime.jpg"                      alt="stop quicktime recording"                ></p><p>In the same way, you need to stop recording by clicking on the Stop button either on the top menu bar or the Recording bar. If this normal way of QuickTime Player stop screen recording does not work, you have to try out the following ways.</p><h2 id="2-Use-Keyboard-Shortcut-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#2-Use-Keyboard-Shortcut-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Keyboard Shortcut to Stop QuickTime Recording"></a>2. Use Keyboard Shortcut to Stop QuickTime Recording</h2><p>The best way to operate any screen recorder is by using the keyboard shortcuts. This is because when you record a screen with an application, the overlay bar stays hidden and if you move the mouse cursor to get the overlay bar, the cursor movement also gets recorded. Therefore, the best way to stop a recording is by pressing the default keyboard shortcut.</p><p>Coming to QuickTime Player, this method of QuickTime stop screen recording shortcut is only applicable when QuickTime Player has not frozen. If it is frozen, you have to force quit the application. Here are the steps to start recording normally and stop QuickTime recording using keyboard shortcut.</p><p>Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File&gt; New Screen Recording. Instead of that, you can press Ctrl + Command + N keys together on your Mac keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-recording.jpg"                      alt="new recording quicktime"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will see the Recording bar where you can set the settings and click on Red button to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-start-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="start screen recording quicktime"                ></p><p>Step 3: If you want to stop recording and you cannot find the Recording bar to click on Stop button, you have to press Esc for Recording bar to reappear and then click on Stop button. However, you can use the keyboard shortcut of Ctrl + Command + Esc keys together to stop recording immediately.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-screen-record.jpg"                      alt="save screen recording"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once the recording stops, you can go to File&gt; Save to export the recording in proper file format.</p><h2 id="3-Force-Quit-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording"><a href="#3-Force-Quit-to-Stop-QuickTime-Recording" class="headerlink" title="3. Force Quit to Stop QuickTime Recording"></a>3. Force Quit to Stop QuickTime Recording</h2><p>If you cannot stop the recording in the normal way as well as with the keyboard shortcut, you have to force quit QuickTime Player. This is because the application might have got frozen for some reason and force quit is the only option available. It is important to note that when you force quit QuickTime, the latest recording will not be saved anywhere. Here are the steps to follow force quit to stop QuickTime screen recording.</p><p>Step 1: Click on Apple menu and then click on Force Quit option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/force-quit-menu.jpg"                      alt="force quit quicktime"                ></p><p>Step 2: You will see a pop-up window where you have to select QuickTime Player. Finally, click on Force Quit button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/force-quit-quicktime.jpg"                      alt="force quit application"                ></p><p>Step 3: You can also use keyboard shortcut to force quit QuickTime.

End Screen Recording in Activity Monitor"></a>4. End Screen Recording in Activity Monitor</h2><p>Just like Windows has Task Manager, Mac has Activity Monitor where you can see all the running applications. Similarly, you can terminate any running application directly from Activity Monitor. Therefore, if you terminate QuickTime Player from Activity Monitor, the application will terminate and the recording will stop. However, you will lose the recording as it does not get saved. Here are the steps to follow to stop screen recording QuickTime.</p><p>Step 1: On your Mac, go to Finder &gt; Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; and finally select Activity Monitor.</p><p>Otherwise, you can go to Spotlight Search to search for Activity Monitor.</p><p>Step 2: Once Activity Monitor opens, select QuickTime Player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-activity-minitor.jpg"                      alt="mac activity monitor"                ></p><p>Step 3: Click on Quit button and QuickTime Player will terminate and the recording will stop automatically.</p><h2 id="5-Best-Alternative-to-QuickTime-for-Recording"><a href="#5-Best-Alternative-to-QuickTime-for-Recording" class="headerlink" title="5. Best Alternative to QuickTime for Recording"></a>5.

Live stream videos have a different feel as the video creators can interact with their audiences in real-time. YouTubers use live streaming feature to stream any live event, take live classes, organize live webinars, and much more. If you want to view the live streaming session of your favorite YouTuber at any future instance, you need to record YouTube live stream.</p><p>In fact, if you are a YouTuber yourself and you are live streaming, you need a YouTube live stream recorder so that you can record your live stream and upload the video on YouTube. YouTube does come with an option to archive your live streams but it is not reliable. Hence, almost all YouTubers opt for an external live stream screen recorder to record their live sessions. Here is the list of the best YouTube live stream screen recorder apps.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We resolutely oppose all forms of copyright-infringing downloads.
