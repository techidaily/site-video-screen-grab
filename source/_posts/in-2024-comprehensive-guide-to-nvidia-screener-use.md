## Part 3\. Performance and Requirements

There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.

However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.

NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10\. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.

* RAM - 4GB or Higher.
* CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.
* AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.
* GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.
* Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.
* Price - Free.
