The recording must be enabled in the Google administrator settings. Otherwise, you won't be able to record on Google Meet.

### 4. A working microphone, screen panel, and camera

Mainly, the microphone and screen panel are involved in recording Google video sessions. So, they must be operational. Plus, if you also want to record footage from your camera, your smartphone must be working too.
