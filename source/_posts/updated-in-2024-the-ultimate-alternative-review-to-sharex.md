## Part 3\. ShareX Alternatives

Capturing screen video as well as webcam video involves complicated steps. Besides, it lacks necessary customizable settings for recording video as well as there is hardly any editing option for the recorded video.

Coming to the user interface, it is rather clumsy and not at all intuitive. Besides, ShareX Mac version is not available, and hence, the recorder is only suitable for Windows users. Considering all these drawbacks, it is better to opt for a better alternative. Here are the best ShareX alternatives you should definitely try out.
