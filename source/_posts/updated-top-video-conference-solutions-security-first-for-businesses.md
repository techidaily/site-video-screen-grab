Next comes the **Network Bandwidth** that depends on the resolution and frame rate you desire that is 1 Mbps for 15 fps at 720p resolution, while 30 fps at 4K will require closer to 4 Mbps with a strong WI-FI network.

 Apart from the system requirements, you will also need a [microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video display screen, and video conferencing equipment, software, or even [video recording software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
