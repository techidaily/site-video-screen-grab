## Functioning

Game recording, device recording, video recording, and screen recording are available with the Bandicam screen recorder for Windows 10\. Let's take a closer look at each one. Mode of Screen Recording: You can record anything on the screen using the tool's screen recording mode. In this mode, users can record anything on their screen, including PowerPoint presentations, the entire screen, a web browser window, Excel spreadsheets, various games, and so on.

* Select the screen recording mode in the top left corner of Bandicam. You have the option of recording the entire screen or a piece of it.
* Select video and other accessible options to establish the software's basic settings.
* Press the "REC" button to start recording your screen. You have the ability to stop the procedure at any time.
* After you've finished recording, go to the menu (Home) and select "Recordings," which will allow you to tweak and personalize your films exactly how you want them.
* The quality of the screen recording option is noticeably lower than that of the tool's game recording mode. In contrast to the others, this model is significantly more user-friendly. We recommend using screen recording mode if you wish to record videos or games with high frame rates.

Game Recording Mode: The next mode of the Bandicam game recorder is game recording. As the name implies, it is clear that users can record their gameplay and view their frames per second with no delays. Its game recording mode is designed specifically for game recording and works well with games that use DirectX, OpenGL, or Vulkan graphics technologies. This mode requires additional gear and allows you to record in high quality from any external source. For the greatest results, while recording game consoles, you should use a PCI/PCI-E capturing card.
