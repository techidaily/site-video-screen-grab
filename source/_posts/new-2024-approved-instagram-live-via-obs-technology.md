## Instagram Live via OBS Technology

Instagram is steadily becoming a great video content platform against the popular belief that it is merely a photo posting platform. In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.

Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones.
