Therefore, go for a screen recorder with audio online and webcam capture.

User-Friendly Interface - The overall interface of the online screen recorder for PC has to be intuitive and user-friendly. This means you should be able to record with a minimum number of steps. Besides, customizing the settings should be easy, and the download option should be readily available. In addition, some screen recorders come with a basic video editor, which is an add-on.
