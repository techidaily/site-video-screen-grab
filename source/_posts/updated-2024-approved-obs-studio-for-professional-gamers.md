You can record gameplay with webcam and mic so that you can showcase your gaming screen along with your reactions and commentary. In general, you cannot upload your gameplay straight away on online platforms. You have to edit out the boring parts and add some effects from better aesthetic value.

Filmora comes with a built-in video editor where you can trim and crop, add audio and video effects, change green screen background, add texts and logos and much more. Naturally, such an edited video will get traction immediately over any straightforward gameplay recording. The first step is to download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer. Here are the steps to follow to record gameplay with Filmora.

## The Bottom Line

We have answered all the queries on how to record gameplay with OBS. OBS is the most preferred desktop software application for live streaming and recording gameplay. However, some gamers find it difficult to use and there are some reports of OBS slowing down performance. As an alternative, we recommend Wondershare Filmora for recording your gameplay with webcam and editing the recorded gameplay for the professional outlook.
