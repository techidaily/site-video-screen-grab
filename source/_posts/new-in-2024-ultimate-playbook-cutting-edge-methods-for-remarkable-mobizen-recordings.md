## Part 3: Tutorial for Using Mobizen Screen Recorder

Mobizen screen recorder for Samsung or other Android devices is easy to use. There are no background complications associated with the workability. However, getting to know the whole process is essential to control any future problems at the right time. So, without delaying this any further, let us have a look at the step-by-step guide for using the Mobizen recorder.

### Step 1: Launching Mobizen Screen Recorder

Pick up your Android phone and launch the Mobizen screen recorder. As soon as you open the software, a bubble called Air Circle appears. The user is expected to open the “Settings” first before starting the screen recording.

### Step 2: Altering the Settings

Adjust the settings of your screen recording. The first functionality is “Video Settings.” Tap on it to alter the resolution, FPS, and quality of the video. The “Clean Recording Mode” can be enabled as per user needs. It helps get rid of the watermark as well as the floating icons.

### Step 3: Changing the Display of Air Circle

Additionally, Mobizen screen recorder APK offers you to minimize the Air Bubble icon and even get rid of it by inserting your own picture and replacing it. The transparency of the Air Circle can also be altered accordingly. The “Hide Mode” hides the icon altogether.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Settings

The “Facecam” feature can be enabled through “Settings,” and its size can be adjusted. As far as the watermark is concerned, you can use that of Mobizen or create your own. The beginners can even set the countdown timer greater than 3 sec to gather their thoughts. The software lets you annotate and draw as well. Enable the feature from the “Draw” tab.
