An inventive puzzle game that mixes Tetris with Sudoku. There are seven balls on the grid, each one of them white or numbered one through seven. It's easy to follow the rules.

Tetris' objective is to keep the balls on the top of the screen while racking up points. Despite being simple, it is challenging and fun. There is no need to download anything to experience everything offline.

There are many other features included in the app, in addition to the puzzles themselves. The Stats page allows you to track your streaks, and the archive will enable you to do puzzles from the past or buy special crossword packs.

A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.
