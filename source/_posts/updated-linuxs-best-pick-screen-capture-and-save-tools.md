Aside from visuals, this tool will also allow users to record accompanying audio from a compatible source. If you are using Ubuntu, to get this app, you simply have to type “Sudo apt-get install Kazaa”.

Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area.
