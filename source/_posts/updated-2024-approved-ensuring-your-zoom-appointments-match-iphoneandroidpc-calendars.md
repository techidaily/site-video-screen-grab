 Owners of Android phones must install [Zoom for Google Calendar](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/zoom%5Ffor%5Fgsuite/364750910244) add-on if they want to sync their Zoom meetings with Google Calendar. The add-on enables you to add Zoom meetings to events in the calendar and includes the details of a meeting in order to simplify the process of joining a meeting for the attendees.

 Once you’ve installed Zoom for Google Calendar add-on Zoom meetings will be added to the calendar as soon as you add a new guest. In case you want to disable this feature you should use your Google Admin Console to access the Apps menu, open G Suite and click on Calendar. Navigate to the Sharing menu, go to the Video Calls section and make sure that the Automatically Add Video Calls to Events Created by a User option is not marked.
