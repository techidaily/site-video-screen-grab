To use the pre-built backgrounds, tap the background you would like to use from the given options. There are numerous options ranging from professional workspaces to a beachside view!

To use the pre-built backgrounds, tap the background you would like to use from the given options. There are numerous options ranging from professional workspaces to a beachside view!

* You need a browser that supports WebGL 2.0
* You need to have a 64-bit operating system

However, if you are meeting all these requirements, have you tried turning your device off and then on, sometimes a reboot does the trick!

**Q) Can I change the background on Google Meet on my phone?**

Of course, you can! You just need to make sure that your device meets all the requirements of using the change background feature on Google Meet, and you are good to go.

## Are You Ready to Change Backgrounds on Google Meet?

The process of changing backgrounds on Google Meet is not complicated at all. All you need to do is follow the steps mentioned above and you can change your background to whatever you please. Whether it is a work meeting or a fun video call with your colleagues - you can adjust your background accordingly to create a better setting for yourself and eliminate all extra elements from your background.

If you have [recorded the Google Meet video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and want to change the video background, then you should try Wondershare Filmora. The Human Segmentation effect under AI Portrait will isolate the people from the video background, and [remove the background even without a green screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and later you can add a new video background.

Check the video tutorial below to find out more details, and download to try Wondershare Filmora for free.
