## Part 2\. Key Features of Screencast-O-Matic Screen Recorder

Here are the key features of Screencast-O-Matic that make it stand out among its competitors.

Screen and Webcam – You can capture your screen as well as your webcam video individually as well as simultaneously. Besides, you can capture system as well as external mic audio narration.

Customization – You can customize the screen size as per your requirements. You can also capture the active window of the currently running application as well as full screen for recording gameplay.

Real-Time Drawing – You can use the drawing tools in real-time while recording to highlight any portion of the screen as well as erase your drawings instantly. Among drawing tools, you get pen, brush, eraser, and outline tools. You can also insert texts wherever required.

Zoom Effect – One of the unique features of Screencast-O-Matic is that it lets you zoom any portion of the screen for better viewing while recording. This is very useful while making tutorial videos where you focus on specific options and zoom in on the options.

Edit Videos – Editing the recorded video is as important as recording the video. You can trim unnecessary parts, add stock music, add captions, as well as highlight cursor movements with the inbuilt video editor. The premium version has options for green screen effect, adding overlays, mixing recordings, removing silences, blurring sensitive information, and much more.

Screenshot and GIFs – If you opt for the premium version of Screencast-O-Matic, you take screenshots while recording as well as create GIFs from your recorded video. There is also an automated speech-to-text captioning option available.

Besides, you can upload the recorded video to YouTube, Google Drive, and Dropbox. You can save the video on your hard drive in MP4 file format.

## Part 4\. Alternative Way To Record Screen Videos
