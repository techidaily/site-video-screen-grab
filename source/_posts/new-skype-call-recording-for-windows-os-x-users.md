## Conclusion

Skype for Business allows the presenters to **record skype meeting** with all the details like video, audio, PowerPoint slides, etc. The in-app recording feature records every members’ video and audio at the same time.

It offers unparalleled features with an intuitive design, and you can record unlimited Skype calls and that with no limitation on Windows or Mac computer systems.
