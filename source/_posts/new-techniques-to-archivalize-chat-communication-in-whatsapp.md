There are two options available for iPhone users depending on iOS version of your iPhone. If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you can use the default screen recorder feature available to record WhatsApp call. However, if your iPhone has iOS lower than 11, you can either update iOS to 11 or use a WhatsApp video call recorder. Otherwise, you can connect your iPhone to Mac, and you can use QuickTime Player to record WhatsApp video call.

Using iOS Inbuilt Screen Recorder -
