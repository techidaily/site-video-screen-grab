## Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet

Filters and effects are an exciting and useful feature offered by Google Meet to its users. However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.

* **Account**

Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.

* **Operating system**

Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.

* **Participation in a video call**

To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.
