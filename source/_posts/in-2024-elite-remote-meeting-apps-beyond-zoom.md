The contribution of Zoom to changing the digital landscape cannot be denied. The outbreak of Covid-19 has also led to a surge in the use of video-conferencing applications, especially Zoom. However, this does not mean that Zoom will fit all requirements. If you are bored of Zoom’s interface or want to host meetings for more than 40 minutes, switching **to Zoom alternatives** is not a bad thing. The above-mentioned video communication platforms will help you make a choice if you are looking for other options.
