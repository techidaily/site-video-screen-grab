## Part 2\. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS

To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom's most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.

### Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS

****Step 1:** Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined. This step should be done before the go-live time to make sure the settings operate. For audio sources that originate from the online call, you may monitor and control via OBS’s Audio Settings.

****Step 2:** Click on the + (Add) button in the Sources section and pick Image. Upload and resize the picture to add your backdrop. You may add a backdrop, face camera frame, text, and screen grab in any manner you wish for the broadcast. It is important to have a backdrop layout ready before adding to your stream.

![click on the add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-the-add.jpg)

****Step 3:** OBS will catch the complete Zoom window; just trim out to capture only your guests’ face cam. You may select “Start Streaming” if you need to webcast the conference elsewhere.

![start streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-streaming.jpg)

If you wish to put yourself into the Stream from your PC associated webcam or other video devices linked, utilize the Video Source Option instead of Window Capture and specify your target device when adding the source. Just make sure you have unmuted the Desktop Audio and Mic/Aux or any mic connected to your PC from the Audio Mixed option at the bottom center of OBS.

## Part 3\. How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS

You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this. Here’s what you need to do:

### Steps to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS

****Step 1:** Launch Zoom and OBS. In OBS, under “Sources,” click the Plus button and choose “Display Capture.” This will work best if you have more than one monitor for your PC, but it will still operate if you just have one.

![window capture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg)
