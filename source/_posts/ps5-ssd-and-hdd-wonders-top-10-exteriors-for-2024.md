## **Latest PS5 Update**

According to Sony, the owners of play station, the PS5 will expand the M.2 SSD storage in its console. The company made it known that users will be capable of storing PS5 games on any external hard drive of their choice. Although you cannot play any games off the hard drive, you can quickly move them to the external hard drive once you are done downloading.

This is one of the most remarkable ways to extend your PS5 console’s storage abilities.
