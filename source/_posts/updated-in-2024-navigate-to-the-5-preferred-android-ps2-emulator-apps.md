You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder. It's now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file. After you've done this, all you have to do is wait for the program to load so that you can begin playing.

**What is the standard frame rate for PlayStation 2 games?**

The emulator's performance when playing a particular game is measured in terms of frame rates. The frame rate, or "FPS" or frames per second, is a typical indication of a game's playability. Around 30 is the typical best ps2 emulator android gaming pace.
