## Way 3\. Use Windows Game DVR

If you want to record a short clip of your gameplay instantly and share on YouTube or other online platform, you can do it easily with Game DVR option available on Xbox One. Game DVR automatically records gameplay in the background and keep them in the buffer so that you can save any recent happening in your gameplay. Otherwise, the recording will get discarded automatically. However, there are many who disable Game DVR feature because it uses system resources significantly. Here are the steps on how to record gameplay on Xbox One.

Step 1: While you are playing a game on Xbox One, press Xbox button twice.
