## Part 1: Requirement of Using Filters and Effects on Google Meet

Filters and effects are an exciting and useful feature offered by Google Meet to its users. However, Google Meet does not allow all accounts to use filters and mask in the same way. To cut the story short, some of the masks and filters might be accessible with workspace, while others are only usable through your personal Gmail accounts. Workplace place accounts need to be professional with limited filters and effects available for them. If you want to know the requirements for using filters and effects on specific devices and different accounts, the following section will discuss them in detail.

* **Account**

Using your personal account rather than the workplace account is better to use maximum filters, effects, and masks. Duo-style filters, AR masks, to name a few, are features that can be easily applied when using Google Meet through personal accounts.

* **Operating system**

Some visual filters and masks are only to be enjoyed when you join video sessions through Android and iOS apps. This means you may not be able to access them through internet browsers.

* **Participation in a video call**

To use filters and effects, you must be a participant in the Google Meet session. So, you must log in preferably through your personal Gmail account to enjoy unlimited filters, effects, and masks.

## Part 2: How to Add Filters, Effects, or Masks on Google Meet?

Google Meet lets you add filters, effects, and masks to make a video call a fun-filled activity. Effects fall in a broader domain. In short, there exist few different categories in effects, including filters, styles, background, and masks. Plus, they are also completely different. Effects are used to enhance the video by adding unique transitions such as fading and other visual effects. On the other hand, filters improve your look by adding different frames and designs in a video. Last but not least, masks add funky faces and covers to your face.

Are you interested in mastering the art of adding filters, effects, and masks? If yes, let’s have a look at the step-by-step guide below.

**Step 1: Launch the application and join the meeting**

Click on Google Meet’s application on your iOS or Android device. Select **join meeting** or **join with a code** to join video session.

**Step 2: Apply effects**

Similarly, when you leave the meeting for some reason and rejoin later, the filters and masks will be automatically removed. Thus, you have to apply them again. Want to learn removing effects, filters, and masks in Google meet? The procedure is summarized in simple steps below.

**Step 1: Access effects**

Click on the **sparkle icon** at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 2: Remove effects**
