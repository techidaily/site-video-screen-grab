## Part 1\. Key Features of Active Presenter

Active Presenter is a popular tutorial and software simulation screen recorder that is known for its key features. It offers many of the same capabilities as a standard screen recorder, allowing users to record any type of video.

Recording – Recording allows you to capture video from your screen and webcam at the same time or independently, and audio from your system or an external microphone. Voice-overs and audio narration can also be added.

Editing – Active Presenter's video and audio editor allows basic editing, such as cutting, copying, pasting and deleting. Complex modifications can also be made to audio and video clips - users can insert clips, speed up or slow down videos, blur items or apply green screen effects to them.

Software Simulation – Apart from recording regular video, you can record software simulation. In software simulation, you get a series of slides instead of a video. These slides can be regular slides or video slides. In video slides, your scrolling actions and drag-and-drop actions are recorded with full-motion recording. Besides, the application creates smart annotations, indicates mouse cursor path as well as mouse clicks and keystrokes on the slides. Moreover, you can add feedback messages and record narration for the software simulation project.

Interactive Quizzes – You can create engaging and interactive quizzes on Active Presenter. You have to select the question slides, add interactive actions and events that users can performance for engagement. You can also set score, time limit, and number of maximum attempts, pass and fail conditions and much more.

Export To HTML – You can export your software simulations and quizzes to HTML5 so that the users can access them online. The design is responsive and hence, it can run on any web browser on any device.

Versatile Export Options – Various export options are available, allowing you to export your video in multiple file formats including MP4, AVI, WMV, and MKV. You can also customize the frame rate, video quality, keyframe parameters, and other settings to decrease the output file size.
