* No advertisements
* Set the timer where the application automatically turns to dark themes soothing your eyes. The user interface is highly customizable.
* High quality resolution
* Navigate the screen recordings as intended
* Devoids rooting
* Record footage while the internet is turned off

Cons

* If the "Stop on Shake" feature is activated the ongoing screen recording can pause with the slightest dislocation or when users shake the device.
* Pauses all recording by default if the screen gets turned off when the "Screen off feature" is turned on.
