**Step 3:** You will see the "Choose Your Camera" option after getting into the settings page. Below will be the drop-down menu; please click on that to see all the camera input methods.

**Step 4:** Change the camera input to the one that you want. For example, to use Canon EOS or Iruin, you need to click on the Choose Your Camera option and select it as the camera input accordingly.

That's about it. You have chosen the third-party camera input, which is now ready to use for Zoom meetings. One good thing about these third-party utilities is that they provide better video resolution.

## Part 5: Best Snap Camera Filters and Lens for Zoom Meetings

To make your Zoom meetings a bit funny, you can choose from a plethora of Snapchat camera filters. You can apply these lenses to your Zoom meeting and have some fun. Since there are many filters to go for, we have curated a list of the best Snap Camera filters that you can save as your favorite in the Snap Camera app. Here they are:

### 1\.  The Potato Lens

![ best Snap Camera lens and filters - potato](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapchat-potato-lens.jpg)

The most popular Snap Camera filter is the potato lens. Phil Walton has created this filter. Once you use it, you will find yourself underground, and your face will be replaced by a potato. However, the potato will have your eyes and mouth. To search for this filter, use the search bar and search for potato.

### 2\.  Cat Filters

Another funny or rather an adorable filter to try is the cat filter. There is a multitude of cat filters available. You can check out the one that you like the most and try it out. This filter became popular after an awkward incident occurred during a virtual legal proceeding, where the advocate turned on the cat filter and appeared as a cat.

### 3\.  Cute Puppy Lens

### 4\.  Donut Glasses Lens
