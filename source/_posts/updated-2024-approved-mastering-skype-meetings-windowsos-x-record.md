## Part 4: Manage Your Recordings

The Skype for Business recording manager allows you to view all the recordings and prepare them for sharing. You can open the recording manager in two ways:

* one way is to open it from the Skype for Business main window by pressing the down arrow or drop-down menu next to the settings icon. Then select “Tools” and “Recording Manager” from the list.

![manage recordings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-recordings17.jpg)

Now that you have access to Skype for Business Recording Manager, you can view a recording, play it, browse its location, rename it, delete it, and publish it online for your viewers.

![access skype recordings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/access-skype-recordings18.jpg)

To prepare it for sharing with other participants, click on the “Publish” button. It will open a “Save and Publish” window where you can name the recording file, specify the location to save, and under the options chose what parts of the meeting to include i.e. video, audio, panorama video, messaging, and presented content. When everything is ready press the “OK” button to save the recorded meeting.

## Conclusion

Skype for Business allows the presenters to **record skype meeting** with all the details like video, audio, PowerPoint slides, etc. The in-app recording feature records every members’ video and audio at the same time. For the limitations of call recording on Mac, Wondershare Filmora can also be a good choice for you. It offers unparalleled features with an intuitive design, and you can record unlimited Skype calls and that with no limitation on Windows or Mac computer systems.
