Some of these tools are only used to capture screenshots and edit the captured images, while some also allow you to capture the whole activity on your screen, namely, [record whatever happening on your Linux screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hope it is helpful for you to find the best screen capture tool based on your needs.
