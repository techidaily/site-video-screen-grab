## Getting Acquainted: The Basics of EZ Grabber Utilization

Are you a full-time gamer or like to rewatch some spectacular scenes from the movies or videos you see on your computer later? But are unable to record those moments separately and at that instant and later need to go back to that point of the scene to record the same. It might get a bit time-consuming and frustrating to do so. For this situation, the ideal problem solver would be installing the **EZ grabber software** on your computer.

The resolution of the videos can touch the heights of 720p, which you can also edit and upload on the internet.
