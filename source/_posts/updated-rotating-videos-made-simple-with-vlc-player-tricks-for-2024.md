Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

## Part 3\. How to Make the Rotation Permanent

The previous methods of VLC player rotate video on Windows and Mac will not save the video in that rotated angle as displayed.

If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.

Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.

Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?
