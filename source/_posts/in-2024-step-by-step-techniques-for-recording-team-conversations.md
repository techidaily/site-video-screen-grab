The licenses that allow recording are Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Essentials, or Business Premium.

**Q2) Who can start or stop a recording of a Teams meeting?**

**A2)** The organizer of the meeting or a person from the same organization can start or stop the recording.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**
