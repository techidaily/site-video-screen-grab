![lol-built-in-function](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lol-built-in-function.png)

Using League of Legends' built-in replay function is the easiest way to record the game. You can also download it separately. A replay button will appear after your match has ended. You can click on this button to watch the replay of your match, and you can also download the replay and save it to your device if you want to. In our opinion, it is the best and most convenient way to record your gameplay because, in this case, you don't need to download any software separately. Everything is built-in here. All you need to do is just play the game and leave the rest to the replay function.

Here is the process for recording gameplay through the built-in method:

* After you start a game, wait until it is over.
* Click on the download button after the match ends. It is situated alongside "Advanced Options" at the top of the screen.
* Wait for a few seconds. This file will be saved in your League of Legends highlights folder.

#### **2\. Using Filmora Screen Recording Option**

You can download the latest version of Filmora (Filmora X) from the official website of Wondershare and start using it for free.
