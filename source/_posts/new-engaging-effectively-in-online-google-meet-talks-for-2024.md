## Part 4: How to Create a Private Chat on Google Meet?

Many individuals wonder if they can privately chat on Google Meet, however that option is not possible in the Google Meet chat feature till now.

While these options are available in other Google Application features such as Gmail and more. They are still yet to come into play on Google Meet.
