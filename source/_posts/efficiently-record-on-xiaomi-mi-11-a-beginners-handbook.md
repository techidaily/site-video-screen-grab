In short, it would be hard to find a screen recorder that takes all the user’s needs under consideration. After the settings have been updated and the recording is done, the tool saves the video automatically to the library.

The user can access the video from there and make necessary changes to it. The changes can be as slight as altering the brightness or saturation of the video and as massive as cropping, trimming, or adding effects to it.

### Conclusion

Xiaomi has made the brand name in a short interval. The article reviewed the Xiaomi screen recorder function and how it comes to the rescue. The renowned screen recorder was also introduced with its key features. Wondershare Filmora was recommended by the end of the write-up as the best screen recorder in the market for Windows and Mac users.
