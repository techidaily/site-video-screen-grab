Most people participate in Google Meet sessions using their laptops or desktop computers. However, they may need to join a video conference while traveling and might not have access to a laptop at that time. Android phones are no less than a blessing in such a scenario. Luckily, you can also share your Android phone's screen with all the meeting participants. So, you don't need to miss an important meeting or a panel discussion. Here are steps to share the screen through your Android phone.

### Step 1: Open up the Google Meet

Tap on the Google Meet app icon to launch it and join the video session.

### Step 2: Start presenting your screen to the participants

## Part 4: How to Share Your Screen When Someone Else is Presenting?

One of the most exciting features of Google Meet is that it allows you to present when someone else is already delivering a presentation. So, if someone has started sharing the screen on your turn or there is some error, you can send a signal to the participant by sharing your screen during their presentation.

Thus, Google Meet does not restrict other members from sharing screens when already one screen is shared. You can easily share your screen during someone else's presentation by following a couple of steps below.

### Step 1: Join a video conference

Connect to the video conference through the invitation link or code.

**Note**: you may create your own meeting if you are hosting a conference.

### Step 2: Start presenting

Click the **Present** **Now** to share the screen based on your need.

### Step 3: Confirm the action

Choose **the Share now** option when a pop-up notification appears, and then your screen will be shared on the meeting.

![  Share Screen on Google Meet when someone else is presenting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-as-presenter-on-google-meet.jpg)

**Note:** The other member presenting will find his presentation paused till you do not end your presentation and cancel screen sharing.

## Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?

Google Meet is usually used for video-conferencing between students, colleagues, or business partners. However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don't want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let's know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.

### Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting

Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click **start a meeting**.

Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.

![  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg)

### Step 2: Share screen without participating

Tap **Present** and select a preferred window to share. By default, the system audio is disabled. Enable it if you need to share the system audio.

![  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-on-google-meet-without-participating.jpg)

**Note**: When you are just sharing the screen with the microphone and camera disabled, other participants will not be able to hear your voice or see you. Similarly, you do not need to turn on the camera and microphone if you are using Google Meet on an Android device, as you can directly share the screen instead of joining a meeting on an Android device.

## Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome

Chrome is not the only way to access video-conferencing tools. There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers. Let's summarize the procedure in simple steps.

### Step 1: Download the preferred browser

Download and launch the browser by clicking on its icon on the desktop or toolbar

### Step 2: Open Google Meet

Search for Google Meet and click **new meeting**.

**Note:** Log in to your Gmail account first**.** You can also directly access Google Meet by entering its official web address. Moreover, if you are not a host, you need to join the meeting through an invite link or code.

### Step 3: Share screen

Click the **Present now** option and choose the window area you want to share from the drop-down menu. Tap the '**allow'** button to start screen sharing.

## Part 3: How to Share Your Android Device's Screen Using Google Meet?

Most people participate in Google Meet sessions using their laptops or desktop computers. However, they may need to join a video conference while traveling and might not have access to a laptop at that time. Android phones are no less than a blessing in such a scenario. Luckily, you can also share your Android phone's screen with all the meeting participants. So, you don't need to miss an important meeting or a panel discussion. Here are steps to share the screen through your Android phone.

### Step 1: Open up the Google Meet

Tap on the Google Meet app icon to launch it and join the video session.

### Step 2: Start presenting your screen to the participants

Click on the **three dots** (ellipsis button) appearing on the top right corner of your phone's or tablet's screen and choose the **share screen** from the list of options in the menu.

## Part 4: How to Share Your Screen When Someone Else is Presenting?

One of the most exciting features of Google Meet is that it allows you to present when someone else is already delivering a presentation. So, if someone has started sharing the screen on your turn or there is some error, you can send a signal to the participant by sharing your screen during their presentation.

Thus, Google Meet does not restrict other members from sharing screens when already one screen is shared. You can easily share your screen during someone else's presentation by following a couple of steps below.

### Step 1: Join a video conference

Connect to the video conference through the invitation link or code.

**Note**: you may create your own meeting if you are hosting a conference.

### Step 2: Start presenting

Click the **Present** **Now** to share the screen based on your need.

### Step 3: Confirm the action

Choose **the Share now** option when a pop-up notification appears, and then your screen will be shared on the meeting.

**Note:** The other member presenting will find his presentation paused till you do not end your presentation and cancel screen sharing.

## Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?

Google Meet is usually used for video-conferencing between students, colleagues, or business partners. However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don't want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let's know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.

### Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting

Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click **start a meeting**.

Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.

![  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg)

### Step 2: Share screen without participating

Tap **Present** and select a preferred window to share. By default, the system audio is disabled. Enable it if you need to share the system audio.

![  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-on-google-meet-without-participating.jpg)

**Note**: When you are just sharing the screen with the microphone and camera disabled, other participants will not be able to hear your voice or see you. Similarly, you do not need to turn on the camera and microphone if you are using Google Meet on an Android device, as you can directly share the screen instead of joining a meeting on an Android device.

## Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome

Chrome is not the only way to access video-conferencing tools. There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers. Let's summarize the procedure in simple steps.

### Step 1: Download the preferred browser

Download and launch the browser by clicking on its icon on the desktop or toolbar

### Step 2: Open Google Meet

Search for Google Meet and click **new meeting**.

**Note:** Log in to your Gmail account first**.** You can also directly access Google Meet by entering its official web address. Moreover, if you are not a host, you need to join the meeting through an invite link or code.

### Step 3: Share screen

Click the **Present now** option and choose the window area you want to share from the drop-down menu. Tap the '**allow'** button to start screen sharing.
