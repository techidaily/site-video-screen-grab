Most WhatsApp users use calling feature for personal communication. However, even corporates use WhatsApp to talk to team members and have a quick discussion. One of the common questions we come across from WhatsApp users “Can WhatsApp call be recorded?”

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts.
