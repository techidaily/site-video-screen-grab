## Resurrect the Past: The Ultimate List of Top 5 PS1 Games for PC

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\.

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program.

* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
