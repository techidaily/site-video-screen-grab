## How to Record with Your MacBook's Camera

In this article, I'll show you how to record your webcam on a Mac using various screen recorders. MacBook has been widely used for quite some time, and it has not only maintained its competitive edge over the years, but has also modernized and improved its services. Apple's operating system also has a built-in video recorder called as QuickTime player. It can also be used for capture and video recording, but it lacks the productivity and customization capabilities of the other tools in this article. The video from the webcam can be fetched along with the option to record a specific part of the screen.

The main aim is to bring to your knowledge the best tool to record from your MacBook’s webcam and modify and alter it to produce the best results possible. Now there are many famous tools such as Filmora, OBS, QuickTime player, Camtasia etc. So I will be listing down their pros and cons for you to decide which one works best for you. They are all great applications but as everyone has a different perspective so there is no such thing as favorite. I am to start with the tool I feel most comfortable with and in my opinion it is the best screen recorder in the market i-e Filmora

## Best Choice - Filmora

Wondershare's Filmora is a well-known and comprehensive video recorder. Wondershare was founded in the year 2003\. Professional video editors oversaw the development of the software.

It offers a very user-friendly interface and simple commands. The nicest part about this software is that it is completely free and works on both Windows and Mac computers.
