# How to Set Up a Zoom Meeting

##### Richard Bennett

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

You may need to learn how to set up a Zoom meeting when you are on a leave or are told to work from home, but still need to communicate with your colleagues in order to discuss on serious topics and/or to take import decisions.

Available for Mac, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux platforms, Zoom lets you easily overcome the barriers of distance as the app allows free video conferencing with up to 100 participants irrespective of their geographical location. The limit of 100 participants can be increased to 300 and 1000 with the paid Business and Enterprise Plus subscription plans respectively.

Going further, this guide explains in detail how to set up a Zoom call or conference, and how to make the entire meeting session simplified and more useful by making minor adjustments to the app. Besides, you will also learn how to set up a Zoom meeting in Outlook and Google Calendar, or how to schedule Zoom meetings for the future.

## Part 1: How to Set Up Zoom Meeting

The good news is, if you are merely a participant of a Zoom meeting that has been hosted by someone else, you don’t necessarily need to download and install the app. You can join the conference by following the URL using your favorite web browser, and typing in the meeting ID and password you are provided with via email or any other method chosen by the host.

On the other hand, if it’s you who is hosting a conference (in other words, starting a conference and want to invite others to join the meeting), Zoom must be installed on your device.

You can learn how to set up a Zoom meeting right from the scratch by following the steps given below:

### Step 1: Download and Install Zoom

![Zoom Meeting Download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-zoom-meeting.jpg)

Launch your favorite web browser (Mozilla Firefox here) on your computer (a Windows 10 PC is used here), go to <https://zoom.us/download>, click **Download**, and follow the on-screen instructions to download Zoom to your local hard drive. Post this, use the **ZoomInstaller.exe** file to install the program, and then proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Launch Zoom and Sign Up

Double-click the **Zoom** shortcut icon on the desktop, click **Sign In**, and use any of the options given in the right section of the next box to sign up for a free Zoom account. Once this is done, back on the box, enter your email address and password you signed up with in their corresponding fields in the left, and click **Sign In** to access your Zoom account.

### Step 3: Set Up New Meeting

Click **New Meeting** on the main interface, wait while the app connects to the server, and optionally click **Join with Computer Audio** to use voice and audio during the conference.

![Zoom Meeting Join ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-join.jpg)

Next, click **Invite** from the bottom of the screen, go to the **Email** tab from the top of the next box that comes up, click your email service provider (**Gmail** for this example), enter the email addresses of the desired participants in the To field on the email draft box, and click **Send**.

![Zoom Meeting Invite People to join ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-invite-people-to-join.jpg)

**Note:** Alternatively, you can use the **Contacts** tab to invite the participants who are already added in your contact list, or use the **Copy URL** or **Copy Invitation** buttons at the bottom to send the invitation manually.

As the target participants receive the mail, they can use the URL and the meeting ID and password to join the Zoom conference. During the process, they can either download the app using the link that the browser displays, or click **join from your browser** that appears when you click, **click here**, and follow along using your web browser without installing the program.

## Part 2: Tips for Better Zoom Meeting Setup

Learning how to set up a Zoom meeting is fairly easy alright, but do you know that the Zoom meetings can be optimized to get the best remote discussion experience?

Following are a few tips that would help you improve the quality of the conferences, and make the visuals more professionals and/or pleasing to the eyes:

#### 1\. Mirror Effect

Enabled by default, the mirror effect lets you flip the video display that the webcam/camera of your device captures during the conference. You can enable or disable the feature by clicking the **Settings** icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window (when not in a conference), selecting **Video** from the left pane, and checking or unchecking the **Mirror my video** box from the right respectively.

![Zoom Meeting Mirror Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-mirror-my-video.jpg)

#### 2\. Appearance Touchup

![Zoom Meeting Touch my appearance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-touch-my-appearance.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467" border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
This feature makes the visuals captured by your webcam or camera less crispy. This comes in handy when you don’t want to distract other participants of the meeting with the imperfections your clothes or sleepy face have when you’re right out of the bed. You can enable or disable this function by checking or unchecking the **Touch up my appearance** box present in the right section of the **Video** category on the **Settings** window respectively.

#### 3\. Virtual Backgrounds

Virtual backgrounds let you hide those untidy and wrinkled bedsheets or wet towels that are usually scattered around when you’re at home. When enabled, you can choose a pleasant scene or environment that is visible to other participants during your video conferences.

![Zoom Meeting change virtual background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-change-virtual-background.jpg)

To select virtual background, you can go to the **Settings** box, click **Virtual Background** category from the left pane, and choose your preferred background from the right. Zoom might take a while to download the required packs if you’re using the feature for the first time. If you’ve a physical green screen background, you can check **I have a green screen**, and then select the correct color for it.

Bonus: green screen is widely used in filming and TV shows, you can get more info about this magical skill in [Green Screen Tutorial](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 4\. Prevent Screen Sharing

![Zoom Meeting  set screen sharing to host only](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/setup-zoom-meeting-only-host-sharing-screen.jpg)

You can keep all the mischievous or ignorant participants from sharing their screen deliberately or accidentally while you’re discussing a serious matter. To do this, while you are in an ongoing conference, click the up-facing arrow next to the **Share Screen** option from the bottom of the camera window, click **Advanced Sharing Options**, and select the **Only Host** radio button from the **Who can share** section on the box that appears next.

#### 5\. Mute Participants

_We've composed an article about schedule a zoom meeting on different devices, you can check it here: [How to Schedule Meetings on Zoom?](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)_

**Note:** You may need to sign in to your Zoom account if not already done yet. You will be prompted to do so with a link present above the message box. Next, type the participants’ IDs in the **Invite attendees** field (the IDs must be added to your Microsoft Outlook account’s contact list before they can be added here), and click **Save** from the top-right corner to schedule a Zoom meeting.

**Conclusion**

The process of how to set up a Zoom meeting is simple, and to learn how to set up a Zoom meeting in Outlook is even simpler. However, for the latter you need to install an add-in that is freely available from the vendor’s official website. Same is the case when you want to use Google Calendar to set up and/or schedule a Zoom meeting with the participants. To conclude, being one of the cheapest solutions (i.e. free in most scenarios) for virtual business meetings and video conferences, Zoom is appreciated by almost all the corporate professionals around the globe.
