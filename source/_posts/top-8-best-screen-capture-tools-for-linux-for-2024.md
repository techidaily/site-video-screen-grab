Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area. It is also a good thing that it is a light file that won’t consume too much memory space. However, it does not come without any problem. Many of those who have used such complained about the lack of webcam viewers. It is also not usable in all configurations.

![Screencaster ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Screencaster.jpg)

![gnome-screenshot-linux ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gnome-screenshot-linux.jpg)

#### 6. [ScreenStudio](http://screenstudio.crombz.com/)
