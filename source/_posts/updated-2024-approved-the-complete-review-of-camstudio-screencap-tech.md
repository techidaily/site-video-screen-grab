Instead of being a completely free screen recorder, CamStudio allows several customization options so that the recording could be as per your requirements. Even though the features are limited, here are the key features of CamStudio recorder you should be aware of.

Video Recording – You can record your screen as well as webcam video individually as well as simultaneously.

Add Components – There is an option for adding annotations if you need it. Besides, you can attach a fixed watermark or text to the recorded video. Moreover, you can add a timestamp on the video if you have such requirements.

## Part 3\. Alternative Way to Record Screen

CamStudio is an easy-to-use and completely free screen recorder, but it lacks several useful features. First of all, there is no basic editing option available. The output file format is limited. There are very limited customizable configuration settings available. Moreover, CamStudio is only suitable for Windows users. The user interface is outdated, and it is not suitable for recording very high-quality screen videos such as gameplay. That is why there is a need for a better CamStudio alternative.
