## Part 2\. Key Features of CamStudio

Instead of being a completely free screen recorder, CamStudio allows several customization options so that the recording could be as per your requirements. Even though the features are limited, here are the key features of CamStudio recorder you should be aware of.

Video Recording – You can record your screen as well as webcam video individually as well as simultaneously.

Audio Recording – Along with videos, you can record audio from your system as well as external microphone. In fact, you can mute audio and record only the video.

Custom Recording Area – You can select a certain portion of the screen for recording as well as select application window or full screen for recording. Instead of a fixed region, you can vary the region of recording as per your requirement.

Add Components – There is an option for adding annotations if you need it. Besides, you can attach a fixed watermark or text to the recorded video. Moreover, you can add a timestamp on the video if you have such requirements.

Autopan and Others – Autopan is a unique feature of CamStudio screen recorder whereby you can record as you move your mouse. You can also highlight your mouse cursor as well as automatically stop recording when you are away.

Output File Format – You can save your recording in MP4, AVI and SWF as you find suitable. It can also automatically name the recording file and save without your intervention after recording.

## Part 3\. Alternative Way to Record Screen
