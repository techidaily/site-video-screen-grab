## FAQs about Zoom Meeting Alternatives

#### 1\. What is a free alternative to zoom?

Though alternatives to Zoom are readily accessible, only a few platforms offer all mainstream and advanced video communication features free of cost. If you are looking for zoom alternative free options, web-based video-conferencing applications, such as Google Meet and Skype, are all you need.

#### 2\. What is the best Zoom alternative for teaching?

#### 3\. What is the best Zoom alternative for musicians?
