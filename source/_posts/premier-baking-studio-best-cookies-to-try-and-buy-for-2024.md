Pros:

* This is the best video call app for iPhone for those that are lazy texters
* The world’s largest online sticker collection
* Access you and your friend’s timeline

Cons:

* If you tried to hold a business meeting using LINE, they would sack you

WeChat is also aimed at the younger generations, but it is more Gen Z and less under-the-age-of-ten.
