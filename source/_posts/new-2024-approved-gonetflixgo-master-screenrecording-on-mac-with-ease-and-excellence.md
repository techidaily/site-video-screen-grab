## GoNetflixGo: Master ScreenRecording on Mac, With Ease & Excellence

Netflix is one of the most popular internet streaming services, with millions of regular customers across the world. Netflix is a streaming service that allows you to subscribe and view movies and TV episodes on your internet-connected devices. With over 222 million customers by the start of 2022, Netflix is likely one of the most popular video streaming services. Netflix will never be boring you with its vast selection of fascinating TV episodes and movies, including action, thrillers, and comedies. This is why Netflix has become everyone's favorite and we can't get enough of it. Netflix does, however, have certain limits.

When you go on a vacation and don't have access to Wi-Fi, you can have trouble viewing your subscription program when it airs. When it comes to screen recording Netflix, there's always the issue of whether or not it's legal. In most cases, the term "illegal" is used to denote a criminal law infringement. Recording and viewing copyrighted works for personal use rather than commercial objectives is not deemed a copyright violation, according to the regulation. You won't be able to view Netflix when your membership expires. Although Netflix allows you to download some movies with tiles, they may be withdrawn from the Netflix channel before you begin binge viewing.

## Method 1: Use QuickTime to Record Netflix

You may use the QuickTime Player to record Netflix episodes on your Mac. It's a built-in multimedia player that can also be used as a screen recorder on almost any Mac. In reality, this program can capture your screen in full-HD (1080p) resolution. It also enables users to utilize hotkeys during capturing to make pausing, restarting, and stopping the recording process simpler. QuickTime Player is a built-in media player for Mac OS X that allows you to watch videos on your computer. With its screen recording capability, Mac users may easily use it as a YouTube video recorder. In addition to video recording, Mac users may utilize the microphone to capture speech or audio.

### **Steps to Record Netflix with QuickTime**

We'll walk you through how to record Netflix using QuickTime in the steps below.

 Step 1: Launch QuickTime Recorder

QuickTime is a great way to start recording Netflix. Select "New Screen Recording" from the "File" menu in QuickTime Player for Mac. You may also adjust the output location, hotkeys, and pointers in the recording's Options. Then, when watching a Netflix video, click the "Record" button to begin recording.

## Conclusion

Netflix has a horrible reputation for deleting TV episodes and movies from your queue before you can binge-watch them. Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what's more, these downloads expire as well. So that's how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.

## Conclusion

Netflix has a horrible reputation for deleting TV episodes and movies from your queue before you can binge-watch them. Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what's more, these downloads expire as well. So that's how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.

## Conclusion

Netflix has a horrible reputation for deleting TV episodes and movies from your queue before you can binge-watch them. Netflix has added a download function that enables you to save TV shows to your smartphone for offline watching. However, the capability is not available for desktop users, and what's more, these downloads expire as well. So that's how simple it is to record Netflix videos. Netflix movies may be recorded in a variety of file formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI, 3GP, and others.
