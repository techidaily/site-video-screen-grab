### 5\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype. It has tons of great features but grew to success in the days when calling was still expensive and video calling was almost unheard of. Skype made waves in the market by being one of the first services to do it all for free.

Skype’s Main Features

Some of the things that earned Skype a place on our list of the best video chat apps for your PC include:

* Skype credit allows you to call mobile phones from your PC.
* Skype Number is their version of the online phone book.
* Call forwarding, voicemail, and Skype Go (which lets you call from mobiles).

### 6\. [Google Duo](https://duo.google.com/about/)

Another of the best video calling apps for pc is the Google Duo app. This is Google’s answer to Skype. It is designed to work across different devices so that you can communicate with friends, even if they are on a Smartphone or a tablet. It is fully compatible with all Google products, which is why it consistently ranks highly in reviews.

Google Duo’s Main Features

Some of the main features of Google Duo include:

* Very high-quality video calling.
* Can group chat with up to 8 other people at once.
* You can get live previews of who calls before you agree to answer, like an internet caller ID.
