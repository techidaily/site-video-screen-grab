If you have played the Ghost of Tsushima and like it so much, you will definitely like this game. Sekiro is a bit more complex and difficult Shinobi-themed game as compare to Ghost of Tsushima. Unlike Ghost of Tsushima, this game contains many monsters to fight with and defeat using Katana. There are two ways of killing your foes, fighting them directly in combat or go stealthy to kill them without getting yourself noticed. This game requires you to use strategy and timing to kill the enemies. Without these two things, it won't be easy to eliminate them.
