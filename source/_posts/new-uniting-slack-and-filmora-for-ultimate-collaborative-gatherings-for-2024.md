## Part 2: How to Record Slack Meetings

All the text messages on Slack are backed up and can easily be searched and shared again. But, what if you start an audio or video Slack meeting? Until now, no feature enables you to record Slack meeting.

Therefore, to record Slack meeting for later use, you will have to use a third-party app like Zoom and integrate it with Slack.

Here is how you can record Slack meeting.

1.Click on the **Apps**tab on the left side menu. Click on **Add** **apps**.
