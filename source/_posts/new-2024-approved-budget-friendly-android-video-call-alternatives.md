In the age of the global pandemic that was caused by COVID-19, social distancing is one of the best ways to prevent this infamous disease from spreading. [Video chat apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allow us to keep in touch with our friends and family during these difficult times without jeopardizing anyone’s safety.

The app’s been labeled as Android’s official response to FaceTime, as it allows its users to receive calls even if they don’t have it installed on their phones.

Google Duo allows you to organize group calls with up to **12 participants**  or send video, audio or text messages. Sharing photos or making voice calls through Google Duo are also some of the options you will have if you decide to use this video chat app.
