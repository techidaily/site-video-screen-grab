 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Have you been on the search for the ideal PS5 external hard drive? Understand that having any of the top ten PS5 external hard drives will assist in solving any struggle you have ever had with storage. Bear in mind that PS5 has an internal SSD of 825GB. While you may think this is big enough, note that some games exceed over 100GB. If you cannot find the time to save all your games in the cloud, it is best to invest in an impressive PS5 external hard drive of 2024\.

## **Latest PS5 Update**

According to Sony, the owners of play station, the PS5 will expand the M.2 SSD storage in its console. The company made it known that users will be capable of storing PS5 games on any external hard drive of their choice. Although you cannot play any games off the hard drive, you can quickly move them to the external hard drive once you are done downloading. In simpler terms, this latest feature will allow users to transfer their PS5 games to a USB extended storage from their console’s internal storage. This is one of the most remarkable ways to extend your PS5 console’s storage abilities.

If you never knew, it will give users a quicker time to reinstall their games from the extended storage than when they copy them from a disc or even re-download them.
