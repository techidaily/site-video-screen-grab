## FAQs About Changing Background in Microsoft Teams Meeting

**Q1) Can I add a video as background in Teams?**

**A1)** At the time of this writing, Microsoft Teams doesn’t support videos as virtual backgrounds natively. However, a quick online search will come up with several links that explain how to use third-party applications in conjunction to get motion effects as a virtual background in the app. This is a workaround for now, and not a permanent solution. You can find more suggestions on this (<https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/cant-change-background-in-microsoft-teams/01d7cd1c-794c-480c-8a45-187bafb52345?auth=1>) thread.

**Q2) Why can’t I change background in Teams?**

**A2)** If you are unable to change background while using Microsoft Teams, there could be a couple of reasons for this including:

* Your computer may not have AVX2 that is required to use the feature
* The IT admin of your organization or school might have disabled the option
* You are using Microsoft Teams on a Linux computer
* Your computer might not meet the minimum hardware requirements to support the feature

You can find more details on this (<https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/cant-change-background-in-microsoft-teams/01d7cd1c-794c-480c-8a45-187bafb52345?auth=1>) link.

**Q3) Why I am not seeing the ‘Show background effects’ option?**

**A3)** At the time of this writing, the option to change the background is visible only on the computers that are equipped with a specific set of hardware. Although Microsoft is in the process of making the feature available for all devices, no official statement has been released by them to date. You can check this (<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/not-able-to-see-background-effects-in-microsoft-teams/m-p/1351987>) link for the detailed discussion. Even after trying the solutions on **how to change background in Microsoft Teams**, if you are unable to get the job done due to the unavailability of the corresponding options, you may have to wait until Microsoft rolls out an update that enables the feature for everyone.

## FAQs About Changing Background in Microsoft Teams Meeting

**Q1) Can I add a video as background in Teams?**

However, a quick online search will come up with several links that explain how to use third-party applications in conjunction to get motion effects as a virtual background in the app. This is a workaround for now, and not a permanent solution. You can find more suggestions on this (<https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/cant-change-background-in-microsoft-teams/01d7cd1c-794c-480c-8a45-187bafb52345?auth=1>) thread.

**Q3) Why I am not seeing the ‘Show background effects’ option?**

## FAQs About Changing Background in Microsoft Teams Meeting

**Q1) Can I add a video as background in Teams?**

**A1)** At the time of this writing, Microsoft Teams doesn’t support videos as virtual backgrounds natively. However, a quick online search will come up with several links that explain how to use third-party applications in conjunction to get motion effects as a virtual background in the app. This is a workaround for now, and not a permanent solution. You can find more suggestions on this (<https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/cant-change-background-in-microsoft-teams/01d7cd1c-794c-480c-8a45-187bafb52345?auth=1>) thread.

**Q2) Why can’t I change background in Teams?**

**A2)** If you are unable to change background while using Microsoft Teams, there could be a couple of reasons for this including:

* Your computer may not have AVX2 that is required to use the feature
* The IT admin of your organization or school might have disabled the option
* You are using Microsoft Teams on a Linux computer
* Your computer might not meet the minimum hardware requirements to support the feature

You can find more details on this (<https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/cant-change-background-in-microsoft-teams/01d7cd1c-794c-480c-8a45-187bafb52345?auth=1>) link.

**Q3) Why I am not seeing the ‘Show background effects’ option?**

**A3)** At the time of this writing, the option to change the background is visible only on the computers that are equipped with a specific set of hardware. Although Microsoft is in the process of making the feature available for all devices, no official statement has been released by them to date. You can check this (<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams/not-able-to-see-background-effects-in-microsoft-teams/m-p/1351987>) link for the detailed discussion. Even after trying the solutions on **how to change background in Microsoft Teams**, if you are unable to get the job done due to the unavailability of the corresponding options, you may have to wait until Microsoft rolls out an update that enables the feature for everyone.
