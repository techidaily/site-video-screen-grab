### Step 1: Launching Mobizen Screen Recorder

Pick up your Android phone and launch the Mobizen screen recorder. As soon as you open the software, a bubble called Air Circle appears. The user is expected to open the “Settings” first before starting the screen recording.

### Step 2: Altering the Settings

Adjust the settings of your screen recording. The first functionality is “Video Settings.” Tap on it to alter the resolution, FPS, and quality of the video. The “Clean Recording Mode” can be enabled as per user needs. It helps get rid of the watermark as well as the floating icons.

### Step 3: Changing the Display of Air Circle

Additionally, Mobizen screen recorder APK offers you to minimize the Air Bubble icon and even get rid of it by inserting your own picture and replacing it. The transparency of the Air Circle can also be altered accordingly. The “Hide Mode” hides the icon altogether.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Settings

The “Facecam” feature can be enabled through “Settings,” and its size can be adjusted. As far as the watermark is concerned, you can use that of Mobizen or create your own. The beginners can even set the countdown timer greater than 3 sec to gather their thoughts. The software lets you annotate and draw as well. Enable the feature from the “Draw” tab.

![edit facecam settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/guideline-to-mobizen-screen-recorder-7.jpg)

### Step 5: Picking Location for the Recording Time

The user can pick the location for screen recording time. The options include “Do not show,” “Inside of Air Circle,” “top left corner,” “top right corner,” and “bottom left corner.”

### Step 6: Start the Recording

After all the settings are updated, relaunch the tool. The Air Circle appears. Tap on it and click on the “Screen Recording” feature in the shape of the video camera. The countdown begins, and screen recording is initiated.
