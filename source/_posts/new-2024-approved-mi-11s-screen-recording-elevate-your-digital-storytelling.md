Before we get into the Xiaomi screen recorder APK, it is essential to understand how Xiaomi came into the field to create a brand name.

Founded in 2010, Xiaomi Inc. has changed the narrative of regular Android devices in the market.

The screen recording feature is one of the most workable traits of the lot.

Screen recording has become a need these days as everything seems to be occurring online. Everything is under the shadow of video and audio recording, from meetings to classes and exams to conferences.
