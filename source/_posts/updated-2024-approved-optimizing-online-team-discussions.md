## Part 1\. Record Hangouts Default Recording Option

The reason why professionals prefer Google Hangouts over its competitors is that there is a default recording option available. Therefore, they can record all the video meetings and webinars for records and future references.

If you have a subscription to any of these two services, here are the steps for Google hangout recording

Step 1: Open your web browser and visit hangouts.google.com.

Step 2: If you are logged into your account, start a meeting by clicking on Video Call option.

## Part 3\. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone

If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.

**For iPhone:**

If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.
